                    To stay up-to-date and help students quickly find the textbooks they need,
                our site only lists textbooks taught at UVA for the current semester.
                If your textbook does not appear in the searchbar, it may not be used in this semester's classes.
                Additionally, we do not have the ability to sell eBooks and access codes, which some classes may require.

                    This class may only need ebooks, access codes or a combination of an access code and a textbook,
                which our site does not provide. We only allow the selling of physical textbooks.

                    When someone adds a book to their cart, it is removed from the available book listings. Someone 
                else might have bought it first. Sorry! Don't worry though, once an item is added to someone's cart
                they have 15 minutes to finish the checkout process or it will be removed from their cart.

                    Based off comprehensive feedback, we found that most UVA students preferred to meet with 
                the other student face to face when buying and selling the textbook. 
                After (or before) purchasing the textook, just message the seller to decide when and where 
                to meet to exchange the textbook! We suggest meeting during the daytime in public places, such
                as the Lawn and other places on Grounds.

                    We don't want anyone to be scammed. As a result, we have an escrow system in place. After placing
                an order, the buyer has two weeks to raise concerns such as "I never got my textbook!" and "This textbook
                is not in as good of condition as I was told!". During this time the money has not been given to the seller
                yet, and if you return the textbook to the seller or demonstrate to us that you never received it, you will get all your money back.
