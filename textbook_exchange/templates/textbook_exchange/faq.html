            To stay up-to-date and help students quickly find the textbooks they need,
            our site only sells textbooks taught at UVA for the current semester.
            If your textbook does not appear in the searchbar, it may not be used in this semester's classes.

        <h4 class="mb-4">I just saw a book in the buy page! Where did it go?</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">
            When someone adds a book to their cart, it is removed from the available book listings. Someone 
            else might have bought it first. Sorry!

        <h4 class="mb-4">The cart does not include shipping. How would I receive the book?</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">
            Based off comprehensive feedback, we found that most UVA students preferred to meet with 
            the other student face to face when buying and selling the textbook. 
            Just message the seller to decide when and where to meet to exchange the textbook!
