This Penguin Classics edition is translated with notes by Ronald Wilks, and an introduction by Robert A. Maguire. This volume includes a selection of Gogol's most admired short fiction and his most famous drama. A hilarious and biting political satire, 'The Government Inspector' has been popular since its first performance and was regarded by Nabokov as the greatest Russian play ever written. The stories gathered here, meanwhile, range from comic to tragic and describe the isolated lives of low-ranking clerks, lunatics and swindlers. They include 'Diary of a Madman', an amusing but disturbing exploration of insanity; 'Nevsky Prospect', a depiction of an artist infatuated with a prostitute; and 'The Overcoat', a moving consideration of poverty. Edited and translated by Ronald Wilks, this new collection of Gogol's shorter writings skilfully captures the savage wit of the original works. Robert Maguire's introduction considers recurrent themes and explores Gogol's influence on realism. This edition also includes detailed notes, a publishing history for each story and a chronology. Nikolai Gogol (1809-52) was born in the Ukraine. His experience of St Petersburg life informed a savagely satirical play, The Government Inspector, and a series of brilliant short stories including Nevsky Prospekt and Diary of a Madman. For over a decade, Gogol laboured on his comic epic Dead Souls - before renouncing literature and burning parts of the manuscript shortly before he died. If you enjoyed The Diary of a Madman, you might like Anton Chekhov's The Steppe and Other Stories, also available in Penguin Classics.

Depicting one woman's struggle to be treated as a rational human being, and not merely a wife, mother or fragile doll, the play changed the course of theatrical history and sparked debates worldwide about the roles of men and women in society. Ibsen's follow-up Ghosts was no less radical, with its unrelenting investigation into religious hypocrisy, family secrets and sexual double-dealing. These two masterpieces are accompanied here by The Pillars of Society and An Enemy of the People, both set in Norwegian coastal towns and exploring the tensions and dark compromises at the heart of society.The new Penguin series of Ibsen's major plays offer the best available editions in English, under the general editorship of Tore Rem. All the plays have been freshly translated by the best modern translators and are based on the recently published, definitive Norwegian edition of Ibsen's works. They all include new introductions by leading scholars and additional editorial apparatus by Tore RemHenrik Ibsen (1828-1906) is often called 'the Father of Modern Drama'. He was born in the small Norwegian town of Skien and started writing plays from an early age. In 1864 he left Norway for a 21-year long voluntary exile in Italy and Germany. After successes with the verse dramas Brand and Peer Gynt, he turned to prose, writing his great 12-play cycle of society dramas between 1877 and 1899. This includedThe Pillars of Society, A Doll's House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People,The Wild Duck, Rosmersholm, The Lady from the Sea, Hedda Gabler,The Master Builder, Little Eyolf, John Gabriel Borkman, and, finally,When We Dead Awaken. Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891 and died there at the age of seventy-eight.Deborah Dawkin and Erik Skuggevik are freelance literary translators.Tore Rem is Professor of British literature at the University of Oslo and author of Henry Gibson/Henrik Ibsen (2006).", "page_count": 400, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIEU2559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-14-130595-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780141305950", "isbn10": "0141305959", "title": "The Shakespeare Stealer", "author": "['Gary L.

Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb introduction and textual commentary provide insightful background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles's translation. This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the general reader, to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.

In the sorrowful tragedy of Billy Budd, Sailor; the controlled rage of Benito Cereno; and the tantalizing enigma of Bartleby, the Scrivener; Melville reveals himself as a singular storyteller of tremendous range and compelling power. In these stories, Melville cuts to the heart of race, class, capitalism, and globalism in America, deftly navigating political and social issues that resonate as clearly in our time as they did in Melville's. Also including The Piazza Tales in full, this collection demonstrates why Melville stands not only among the greatest writers of the nineteenth century, but also as one of our greatest contemporaries.

After the Arab Spring of 2011, many pointed to the liberating potential of platforms like Facebook andTwitter. Yet five years later, as many Americans reeled in shock from the election of an authoritarian bullshit artist (using philosopher Harry Frank's technical definition of the term), a few perceptive observers began looking at new at the social and political effects of dominant social mediaplatforms, particularly Facebook. And they did not like what they saw.The media studies and IP scholar Siva Vaidhyanathan is one of those sharp observers, and in Anti-Social Media he argues that our descent into dystopia stems in no small part from trends that have developed in the online world. The 2016 election saw a remarkable and dispiriting increase of peoplehiving themselves off within ideological echo chambers and treating fake news as real. Vaidhyanathan provides a structural explanation of why this happened, and he has located a culprit: social media, and more specifically Facebook. The founders of Facebook may have had (some) good intentions, buthe contends that they have created a Frankenstein's monster that they have neither the will nor capacity to rein in. Fake news abounds, and the algorithms that undergird the platform drive people inexorably to news sites that conform to their ideological predilections - which Facebook can figure outwith ease. Serious news reporting, already in a parlous state, has suffered even more as people on platforms like Facebook (meaning most people) are bombarded by both snippets of news from multiple sources and ads that look like news. Deliberative democracies require informed citizenries able todistinguish facts and falsehoods. By weakening those skills, social media is eroding the very foundations of our democratic republican culture.

Here the author uses mathematics not so much to prove axio-matic theory as to support and enhance physical and intuitive understanding. Wherever possible, theoretical results are interpreted heuristically and are enhanced by carefully chosen examples and analogies. The organization of the text allows for a great deal of flexibility in teaching continuous-time and discrete-time concepts.

But one particular strain of Christianity prospers more than most -- Pentecostalism. Pentecostals believe that everyone can personally receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit such as prophecy or the ability to speak in tongues. In Africa, this kind of faith, in which the supernatural is a daily presence, is sweeping the continent. Today, about 107 million Africans are Pentecostals -- and the numbers continue to rise. In this book, Ogbu Kalu provides the first ever overview of Pentecostalism in Africa. He shows the amazing diversity of the faith, which flourishes in many different forms in diverse local contexts. While most people believe that Pentecostalism was brought to Africa and imposed on its people by missionaries, Kalu argues emphatically that this is not the case. Throughout the book, he demonstrates that African Pentecostalism is distinctly African in character, not imported from the West. With an even-handed approach, Kalu presents the religion's many functions in African life. Rather than shying away from controversial issues like the role of money and prosperity in the movement, Kalu describes malpractice when he sees it. The only book to offer a comprehensive look at African Pentecostalism, this study touches upon the movement's identity, the role of missionaries, media and popular culture, women, ethics, Islam, and immigration.

The documents are arranged chronologically in each of eleven chapters and are meticulously and extensively annotated and cross-referenced in order to provide the student with ready access to a wide variety ofissues, key historical figures, and events.

Bradford Wilcox and Nicholas Wolfinger illuminate the largely positive influence that churches have on relationships and marriage among African Americans and Latinos. Soul Mates shines a much needed spotlight on strong and happy minority couples. The authors reveal that both married and unmarried minority couples who attend church together are much more likely to enjoy happy relationships and to get and stay married, in comparison to similar couples who do not regularly attend church. In particular, they describe how churches serving these communities promote a ''code of decency'' encompassing hard work, temperance, and personal responsibility, as well as an ethic based on the Golden Rule, all of which strengthens minority relationships. But this book also shows that religion is no silver bullet when it comes to addressing the challenges facing African Americans and Latinos. Infidelity, domestic violence, and divorce-among other things-can be found among the ranks of black and Latino churchgoers. Religious faith and religious participation offer no guarantees of a happy family life. Indeed, this book provides the first systematic evidence that religiosity does not substantially affect the likelihood that African Americans and Latinos will engage in sex before marriage or have a child out of wedlock. The authors offer compelling evidence as to why this is the case, focusing on the unique economic and cultural challenges facing African Americans and Latinos in twenty-first century America. Soul Mates offers a wealth of critical insight into the effect of religion on black and Latino relationships. It is also in invaluable source of concrete strategies for pastoral leaders in these communities.", "page_count": 272, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["SOC4057-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-19-539534-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780195395341", "isbn10": "0195395344", "title": "Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice", "author": "['Mark Singleton']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4oAjDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4oAjDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 17.95, "bookstore_used_price": 13.46, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "date": "2010-02-25", "description": "The practice of yoga has become hugely popular in the West.

It states that securities prices in financial markets must equal fundamental values, either because all investors are rational or because arbitrage eliminates pricing anomalies.This book describes an alternative approach to the study of financial markets: behavioral finance. This approach starts with an observation that the assumptions of investor rationality and perfect arbitrage are overwhelmingly contradicted by both psychological and institutional evidence. In actual financial markets, less than fully rational investors trade against arbitrageurs whose resources are limited by risk aversion, short horizons, and agency problems. The book presents and empiricallyevaluates models of such inefficient markets.Behavioral finance models both explain the available financial data better than does the efficient markets hypothesis and generate new empirical predictions. These models can account for such anomalies as the superior performance of value stocks, the closed end fund puzzle, the high returns on stocks included in market indices, the persistence of stock price bubbles, and even the collapse of several well-known hedge funds in 1998.

Suetonius composed his material from a variety of sources, without much concern for their reliability. His biographies consist the ancestry and career of each emperor in turn; however, his interest is not so much analytical or historical, but anecdotal and salacious which gives rise to a lively and provocative succession of portraits. The account of Julius Caesar does not simply mention his crossing of the Rubicon and his assassination, but draws attention to his dark piercing eyes and attempts to conceal his baldness. The Live of Caligula presents a vivid picture of the emperor's grotesque appearance, his waywardness, and his insane cruelties. The format and style of Suetonius' Lives of the Caesars was to set the tone for biography throughout western literature - his work remains thoroughly readable and full of interest.

In just over one hundred pages, Ralph W. Tyler presented the concept that curriculum should be dynamic, a program under constant evaluation and revision. Curriculum had always been thought of as a static, set program, and in an era preoccupied with student testing, he offered the innovative idea that teachers and administrators should spend as much time evaluating their plans as they do assessing their students. Since then, Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction has been a standard reference for anyone working with curriculum development. Although not a strict how-to guide, the book shows how educators can critically approach curriculum planning, studying progress and retooling when needed. Its four sections focus on setting objectives, selecting learning experiences, organizing instruction, and evaluating progress. Readers will come away with a firm understanding of how to formulate educational objectives and how to analyze and adjust their plans so that students meet the objectives. Tyler also explains that curriculum planning is a continuous, cyclical process, an instrument of education that needs to be fine-tuned. This emphasis on thoughtful evaluation has kept Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction a relevant, trusted companion for over sixty years. And with school districts across the nation working feverishly to align their curriculum with Common Core standards, Tyler's straightforward recommendations are sound and effective tools for educators working to create a curriculum that integrates national objectives with their students' needs.", "page_count": 140, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDIS8800-500"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-226-11237-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780226112381", "isbn10": "0226112373", "title": "The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before And After Reform", "author": "['Marty Cohen', 'David Karol', 'Hans Noel', 'John Zaller']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/81/9780226112381.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 28.0, "bookstore_used_price": 20.9, "publisher": "University Of Chicago Press", "date": "2008", "description": "Throughout The Contest For The 2008 Democratic Presidential Nomination, Politicians And Voters Alike Worried That The Outcome Might Depend On The Preferences Of Unelected Superdelegates.

Sixty years ago, the University of Chicago Press undertook a momentous project: a new translation of the Greek tragedies that would be the ultimate resource for teachers, students, and readers. They succeeded. Under the expert management of eminent classicists David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, those translations combined accuracy, poetic immediacy, and clarity of presentation to render the surviving masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in an English so lively and compelling that they remain the standard translations. Today, Chicago is taking pains to ensure that our Greek tragedies remain the leading English-language versions throughout the twenty-first century. In this highly anticipated third edition, Mark Griffith and Glenn W. Most have carefully updated the translations to bring them even closer to the ancient Greek while retaining the vibrancy for which our English versions are famous. This edition also includes brand-new translations of Euripides\u2019 Medea, The Children of Heracles, Andromache, and Iphigenia among the Taurians, fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus, and the surviving portion of Sophocles\u2019s satyr-drama The Trackers. New introductions for each play offer essential information about its first production, plot, and reception in antiquity and beyond. In addition, each volume includes an introduction to the life and work of its tragedian, as well as notes addressing textual uncertainties and a glossary of names and places mentioned in the plays.

Walker; \u201cThe Cyclops,\u201d translated by William Arrowsmith; and \u201cRhesus,\u201d translated by Richmond Lattimore. Sixty years ago, the University of Chicago Press undertook a momentous project: a new translation of the Greek tragedies that would be the ultimate resource for teachers, students, and readers. They succeeded. Under the expert management of eminent classicists David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, those translations combined accuracy, poetic immediacy, and clarity of presentation to render the surviving masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in an English so lively and compelling that they remain the standard translations. Today, Chicago is taking pains to ensure that our Greek tragedies remain the leading English-language versions throughout the twenty-first century. In this highly anticipated third edition, Mark Griffith and Glenn W. Most have carefully updated the translations to bring them even closer to the ancient Greek while retaining the vibrancy for which our English versions are famous. This edition also includes brand-new translations of Euripides\u2019 Medea, The Children of Heracles, Andromache, and Iphigenia among the Taurians, fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus, and the surviving portion of Sophocles\u2019s satyr-drama The Trackers. New introductions for each play offer essential information about its first production, plot, and reception in antiquity and beyond. In addition, each volume includes an introduction to the life and work of its tragedian, as well as notes addressing textual uncertainties and a glossary of names and places mentioned in the plays.

Meticulously researched and anchored to real politics, Krehbiel argues that the pivotal vote on a piece of legislation is not the one that gives a bill a simple majority, but the vote that allows its supporters to override a possible presidential veto or to put a halt to a filibuster. This theory of pivots also explains why, when bills are passed, winning coalitions usually are bipartisan and supermajority sized.

While many accounts of education in urban and metropolitan contexts describe schools as the victims of forces beyond their control, Erickson shows the many ways that schools have been intertwined with these forces and have in fact\u2014via land-use decisions, curricula, and other tools\u2014helped sustain inequality. Taking Nashville as her focus, Erickson uncovers the hidden policy choices that have until now been missing from popular and legal narratives of inequality. In her account, inequality emerges not only from individual racism and white communities\u2019 resistance to desegregation, but as the result of long-standing linkages between schooling, property markets, labor markets, and the pursuit of economic growth. By making visible the full scope of the forces invested in and reinforcing inequality, Erickson reveals the complex history of, and broad culpability for, ongoing struggles in our schools.", "page_count": 416, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF7602-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-226-55553-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780226555539", "isbn10": "0226555534", "title": "Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, 1930-1970", "author": "['Doug McAdam', 'Professor of Sociology Doug McAdam']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ADiJTD8s4KYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ADiJTD8s4KYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 31.0, "bookstore_used_price": 23.13, "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "date": "1999-11-22", "description": "In this classic work of sociology, Doug McAdam presents a political-process model that explains the rise and decline of the black protest movement in the United States.

Yet, despite their relatively small numbers, the members of these two minority groups often find themselves the focus of a disproportionate amount of media attention, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Beyond such international issues, American Jews and American Muslims find themselves struggling with similar inter-communal concerns when it comes to matters like education (for example tensions between student populations of Jews and Muslims on university campuses), politics (such as the swearing in of the first Muslim Congressman in the House of Representatives, Keith Ellison, or the omnipresent emails and robo-calls linking President Obama to the Muslim community that emerged during the 2008 Presidential election), or even pop culture (think of such recent Hollywood productions as Kingdom in Heaven, Munich, Paradise Now, and Traitor, to name but a few). In all of these matters, American Jews and American Muslims have consistently engaged each other in conversation \u2013 whether directly or indirectly; constructive or not \u2013 in ways that have usually eluded their co-religionists throughout the rest of the world. This has partly to do with America\u2019s ethos as a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of different religions, ethnicities, and cultures. But it also has to do with the innovative ways in which Judaism and Islam have absorbed, and been radically altered, by the so-called \u201cAmerican experience.\u201d This book is an exploration of contemporary Jewish-Muslim relations in the United States and the distinct and often creative ways in which these two communities interact with one another in the American context. Each essay discusses a different episode from the recent twentieth and current twenty-first century American milieu that links these two groups together. Some deal with case examples of local inter-communal interaction, such as \u201cdialogue groups,\u201d which can help us better understand national trends of similar activities in other parts of the country. Others focus on national trends themselves, thus giving us greater insights into individual incidents.", "page_count": 228, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELI2024-100", "RELJ2024-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-230-29423-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780230294233", "isbn10": "0230294235", "title": "Animal Cognition: Evolution, Behavior And Cognition Animal Cognition: Evolution, Behavior & Cognition", "author": "['Wynne, Clive D.

McIntyre analyzes recent examples -- claims about inauguration crowd size, crime statistics, and the popular vote -- and finds that post-truth is an assertion of ideological supremacy by which its practitioners try to compel someone to believe something regardless of the evidence. Yet post-truth didn't begin with the 2016 election; the denial of scientific facts about smoking, evolution, vaccines, and climate change offers a road map for more widespread fact denial. Add to this the wired-in cognitive biases that make us feel that our conclusions are based on good reasoning even when they are not, the decline of traditional media and the rise of social media, and the emergence of fake news as a political tool, and we have the ideal conditions for post-truth. McIntyre also argues provocatively that the right wing borrowed from postmodernism -- specifically, the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth -- in its attacks on science and facts. McIntyre argues that we can fight post-truth, and that the first step in fighting post-truth is to understand it.", "page_count": 240, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 3, "class_objects": ["MDST3680-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-271-01994-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780271019932", "isbn10": "027101993X", "title": "David Walker's Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World", "author": "['David Walker', 'Peter P.

Decrying the savage and unchristian treatment blacks suffered in the United States, Walker challenged his &\u201cafflicted and slumbering brethren&\u201d to rise up and cast off their chains. Walker worked tirelessly to circulate his book via underground networks in the South, and he was so successful that Southern lawmakers responded with new laws cracking down on &\u201cincendiary&\u201d antislavery material. Although Walker died in 1830, the Appeal remained a rallying point for African Americans for many years to come, anticipating the radicalism of later black leaders, from Malcolm X to Martin Luther King, Jr. In this new edition of the Appeal, the first in over thirty years, Peter P. Hinks, the leading authority on David Walker, provides a masterly introduction and extensive annotations that incorporate the most up-to-date research on Walker, much of it first reported by Hinks in his highly acclaimed biography, To Awaken My Afflicted Brethren. Hinks also includes a unique appendix of documents showing the contemporary response&\u2014from North and South, black and white&\u2014to the Appeal itself and Walker&\u2019s attempts to distribute it in the South.

By showing how legislative leaders build coalitions for both types of programs, he illuminates recent legislative decisions in such areas as economic, tax, and energy policy. Arnold's theory of policy making rests on a reinterpretation of the relationship between legislators' actions and their constituents' policy preferences. Most scholars explore the impact that citizens' existing policy preferences have on legislators' decisions. They ignore citizens who have no opinions because they assume that uninformed citizens cannot possibly affect legislators' choices. Arnold examines the influence of citizens' potential preferences, however, and argues that legislators also respond to these preferences in order to avoid future electoral problems. He shows how legislators estimate the political consequences of their voting decisions, taking into account both the existing preferences of attentive citizens and the potential preferences of inattentive citizens. He then analyzes how coalition leaders manipulate the legislative situation in order to make it attractive for legislators to support a general interest bill.", "page_count": 282, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["LPPP4200-ALL"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-300-08988-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780300089882", "isbn10": "0300089880", "title": "Georgian London", "author": "['John Summerson', 'Howard Montagu Colvin']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qVXAQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qVXAQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 18.0, "bookstore_used_price": 13.43, "publisher": "Paul Mellon Ctr for Studies", "date": "2003", "description": "In this classic of English architectural history, John Summerson provides an account of a major building period in the history of London.

In this major new history of battle from the age of Homer through the decline of the Roman empire, J. E. Lendon surveys a millennium of warfare to discover how militaries change--and don't change--and how an army's greatness depends on its use of the past. Noting this was an age that witnessed few technological advances, J. E. Lendon shows us that the most successful armies were those that made the most effective use of cultural tradition. Ancient combat moved forward by looking backward for inspiration--the Greeks, to Homer; the Romans, to the Greeks and to their own heroic past. The best ancient armies recruited soldiers from societies with strong competitive traditions; and the best ancient leaders, from Alexander to Julius Caesar, called upon those traditions to encourage ferocious competition at every rank. Ranging from the Battle of Champions between Sparta and Argos in 550 B.C. through Julian's invasion of Persia in A.D. 363, Soldiers and Ghosts brings to life the most decisive military contests of ancient Greece and Rome. Lendon places these battles, and the methods by which they were fought, in a sweeping narrative of ancient military history. On every battlefield, living soldiers fought alongside the ghosts of tradition--ghosts that would inspire greatness for almost a millennium before ultimately coming to stifle it.", "page_count": 468, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 4, "class_objects": ["HIEU3021-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-300-14337-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780300143379", "isbn10": "0300143370", "title": "Arms and Influence: With a New Preface and Afterword", "author": "['Thomas C.

Drawing on extensive archival research, including newly discovered letters and pamphlets, Sinha documents the influence of the Haitian Revolution and the centrality of slave resistance in shaping the ideology and tactics of abolition.

When Everything Changed begins in 1960, when most American women had to get their husbands' permission to apply for a credit card. It ends in 2008 with Hillary Clinton's historic presidential campaign. This was a time of cataclysmic change, when, after four hundred years, expectations about the lives of American women were smashed in just a generation. A comprehensive mix of oral history and Gail Collins's keen research--covering politics, fashion, popular culture, economics, sex, families, and work--When Everything Changed is the definitive book on five crucial decades of progress. The enormous strides made since 1960 include the advent of the birth control pill, the end of \"Help Wanted--Male\" and \"Help Wanted--Female\" ads, and the lifting of quotas for women in admission to medical and law schools. Gail Collins describes what has happened in every realm of women's lives, partly through the testimonies of both those who made history and those who simply made their way. Picking up where her highly lauded book America's Women left off, When Everything Changed is a dynamic story, told with the down-to-earth, amusing, and agenda-free tone for which this beloved New York Times columnist is known. Older readers, men and women alike, will be startled as they are reminded of what their lives once were--\"Father Knows Best\" and \"My Little Margie\" on TV; daily weigh-ins for stewardesses; few female professors; no women in the Boston marathon, in combat zones, or in the police department.

They address complex questions secondary English teachers wrangle with daily: where does literature live within the Common Core's mandates? How can we embrace informational texts in our literature classrooms? And most importantly, how can we help students recognize how canonical works are relevant to them? Their solution is to create an integrated, side-by-side blend of canonical texts with works of contemporary authors and multimedia resources which help build a bridge to literacy, and provide the \"here-and-now\" students crave today.

The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran's last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran: of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life and of the enormous toll repressive regimes exact on the individual spirit. Marjane's child's-eye-view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a stunning reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, through laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.", "page_count": 153, "google_rating": 4.5, "num_reviews": 4, "class_objects": ["AMST3559-1", "HIUS3559-1", "PETR3559-2", "PETR5559-3"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-375-71488-X", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780375714887", "isbn10": "037571488X", "title": "A.D.: New Orleans After the Deluge", "author": "['Josh Neufeld']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_TX_QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_TX_QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.95, "bookstore_used_price": 8.94, "publisher": "Pantheon Books", "date": "2010", "description": "Uses graphic novel format to depict the events of Hurricane Katrina though six true stories of New Orleanians who survived the storm, including Denise, who experienced the chaos of the Superdome, and a doctor whose French Quarter home was unscathed.", "page_count": 193, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 12, "class_objects": ["ENWR1510-4"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-375-72469-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780375724695", "isbn10": "0375724699", "title": "Papeles De Pandora", "author": "['Rosario Ferr\u00e9']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uhQGIDGQuGkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uhQGIDGQuGkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.95, "bookstore_used_price": 7.94, "publisher": "Vintage Books", "date": "2000", "description": "A collection of short fiction explores the ever-evolving roles of women in a fast-changing but patriarcal culture, in such tales as \"La mu\u00b1eca menor,\" \"La bella durmiente,\" and \"Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres.\" By the author of The House on the Lagoon.

It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind\u2014the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros. Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity. Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt. Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey. Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.", "page_count": 127, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 18, "class_objects": ["GETR3462-1", "GETR3590-4", "HIEU3462-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-393-30881-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780393308815", "isbn10": "0393308812", "title": "The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge", "author": "['Rainer Maria Rilke', 'M.

Through the telling of dramatic personal stories, Dr. Steele shares the process of constructing and completing experiments and statistical studies that show that exposing subjects to stereotypes - merely reminding a group of female math majors about to take a math test, for example, that women are considered naturally inferior to men at math - impairs their performance in the area affected by the stereotype. Steele's conclusions shed new light on a host of American social phenomena, from the racial and gender gaps in standardized test scores to the belief in the superior athletic prowess of black men. As Homi Bhabha states, 'Steele's book is both urgent and important in understanding the tyranny of the stereotype and liberating ourselves from its derogatory, one-dimensional vision.' Whistling Vivaldi presents a new way of looking at identity and the way it is shaped by social expectations, and, in Richard Thompson Ford's words, 'offers a clear and compelling analysis and, better still, straightforward and practical solutions.'", "page_count": 256, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 14, "class_objects": ["EDHS7300-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-393-34451-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780393344516", "isbn10": "0393344517", "title": "Buzzed: The Straight Facts about the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy", "author": "['Cynthia Kuhn', 'Scott Swartzwelder', 'Wilkie Wilson', 'Leigh Heather Wilson', 'Jeremy Foster']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1HrdnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1HrdnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.54, "bookstore_used_price": 9.91, "publisher": "W W Norton & Company Incorporated", "date": "2014", "description": "Provides current, factual information about many of the most commonly used and abused drugs, looking at how they affect the brain, their short and long term effects, the highs they produce, and the dangers associated with them.", "page_count": 385, "google_rating": 4.5, "num_reviews": 3, "class_objects": ["EDHS2230-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-393-34678-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780393346787", "isbn10": "0393346781", "title": "The Feminine Mystique (50th Anniversary Edition)", "author": "['Betty Friedan']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/87/9780393346787.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 17.95, "bookstore_used_price": 8.93, "publisher": "W.

The novel, which is accompanied by revised and expanded explanatory annotations, is followed by the two canceled chapters that comprise Persuasion?s original ending. ?Backgrounds and Contexts? collects contemporary assessments of Jane Austen as well as materials relating to the social issues of the day. Included are an excerpt from William Hayley?s 1785 ?Essay on Old Maids?; Austen?s letters to Fanny Knight, which reveal her skepticism about marriage as the key to happiness; Henry Austen?s memorial tribute to his famous sister; assessments by nineteenth-century critics Julia Kavanagh and Goldwin Smith, who viewed Austen as an unassuming, sheltered, and ?feminine? rural writer; and the perspective of Austen?s biographer, Geraldine Edith Mitten. The Second Edition emphasizes current critical scholarship, reflecting enormous shifts in our comprehension of Austen?s achievement and opening the door to new ways of thinking about Persuasion and its author. For the first time, we can think complexly about Austen living through the Napoleonic Wars on the Continent and experiencing their political repercussions at home?the same as everyone else in England at that time.

Set in an unnamed gulf country that could be Jordan sometime in the 1930s, the novel relates what happens to the bedouin inhabitants of the small oasis community of Wadi al-Uyoun when oil is discovered by Americans. Seen through the eyes of a large and varied cast of bedouin characters, the upheaval caused by the American colonization is shown in various manifestations, from the first contact with the strange foreigners (``Their smell could kill birds!'' observes Miteb al-Hathal, who later leads a rebellion of Arab workers when the village of Harran has been made into an American port city) to confused and suspicious descriptions of the sinister ``magic'' tools brought by the Americanswhich are in fact bulldozers, automobiles, radios and telephones. The story unfolds at a stately pace over a timespan of many years and provides an endless stream of characters and events, each connected to the next by many threads of plot. Theroux's sensitive translation conveys the subtleties of ambiguity and nuance inherent to the Arab language and culture. Banned in several Mideast countries including Saudi Arabia, this is the first volume of a planned trilogy by a Paris-based Jordanian novelist who holds a law degree from the Sorbonne and a Ph.D. in oil economics from the University of Belgrade. Despite the Lawrence of Arabia setting, Munif writes from a unique vantage point; English-language readers have been given few opportunities before now to look at this situation through native eyes.

Why does she ignite such passionate loyalty \u2013 and such loathing? How did her candidacy mobilize new parts of the electorate? Using the notion of \"framing\" as a way of understanding political perception, the authors analyze the narratives told by and about Sarah Palin in the 2008 election \u2013 from beauty queen, maverick, faithful fundamentalist and post-feminist role model to pit bull hockey mom, frontier woman, and political outsider. They discuss where those frames are rooted historically in popular and political culture, why they were selected, and the ways that the frames resonated with the electorate. Framing Sarah Palin addresses the question of what the choice and perception of these frames tells us about the state of American politics, and about the status of American women in politics in particular. What do the debates engendered by these images of Palin say about the current roles and power available to women in American society?

Members Of This New Cohort, Such As Cory Booker, Artur Davis, And Barack Obama, Have Often Publicly Clashed With Their Elders, Either In Campaigns Or Over Points Of Policy.

Part of a series of pseudoscientific romances written by H. G. Wells (1866\u20131946) early in his career, the novel helped establish the British author as one of the first and best writers of science fiction. Wells' years as a science student undoubtedly inspired a number of his early works, including this strikingly original novel. Set in turn-of-the-century England, the story focuses on Griffin, a scientist who has discovered the means to make himself invisible. His initial, almost comedic, adventures are soon overshadowed by the bizarre streak of terror he unleashes upon the inhabitants of a small village.

He also charges that the strategy of accommodation to white supremacy advanced by Booker T. Washington, then the most influential black leader in America, would only serve to perpetuate black oppression. Publication of The Souls of Black Folk was a dramatic event that helped to polarize black leaders into two groups: the more conservative followers of Washington and the more radical supporters of aggressive protest.

The friends were summering on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland in 1816, Shelley still unknown as a poet and Byron writing the third canto of Childe Harold. When continued rains kept them confined indoors, all agreed to Byron's proposal. The illustrious poets failed to complete their ghost stories, but Mary Shelley rose supremely to the challenge. With Frankenstein, she succeeded admirably in the task she set for herself: to create a story that, in her own words, \"would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror \u2014 one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.\"", "page_count": 166, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ENGL4540-1", "ENGL8540-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-486-28472-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780486284729", "isbn10": "0486284727", "title": "The Time Machine", "author": "['H.

After narrowly escaping from the Morlocks, the Time Traveller undertakes another journey even further into the future where he finds the earth growing bitterly cold as the heat and energy of the sun wane.

The Chinese court was otherwise uninterested in foreign lands. Its principal interests were to maintain peace with what it perceived to be barbarian neighbors and to coax or coerce them into admitting China's superiority and accepting the Chinese emperor as the Son of Heaven. But Chinese foreign policy was not monolithic. Court officials in traditional times were much more realistic and pragmatic than is commonly assumed. They did not scorn foreign trade, nor were ignorant of foreign lands. Challenging the accepted view of Chinese foreign relations, the authors of China among Equals contribute to a clearer assessment of Chinese foreign relations and policy. From the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, China did not dogmatically enforce its own world order. Chinese were eager for foreign trade and knowledgeable about their neighbors. The Sung (960-1279), the principal dynasty during that era, was flexible in its dealings with foreigners. Its officials recognized the military and political weakness of the dynasty, and in general they adopted a realistic and pragmatic foreign policy.

The first is the seemingly widespread lack of motivation for participating in political activity. The second is the political and intellectual focus on critique rather than offering alternatives for possible futures. This book addresses these concerns by offering an ethnographically and theoretically rich look at the political and ethical activity of some unlikely political actors - active and former users of heroin and crack cocaine. Despite this unlikelihood, however, this book shows and argues that the globally-networked anti-drug war movement organized and run by drug users is, in fact, at the forefront of offering an alternative political and social imaginary. In particular, the book focuses on how this anti-drug war imaginary and political activity is enacting non-normative, open, and relationally-inclusive alternatives to such key ethical-political concepts as community, freedom and care. Ultimately, A War on People argues that in a contemporary condition increasingly characterized by widely-diffused complexity and war as governance, an anthropology of potentiality is needed to discern and creatively conceptualize the emerging not-yet of the worlds we research and inhabit\"--Provided by publisher.", "page_count": 208, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ANTH3290-1", "ANTH3590-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-521-00976-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780521009768", "isbn10": "0521009766", "title": "Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists", "author": "['Gerry P.

In marriages and families, in business partnerships and social organizations, and in governments and supranational relationships, rules of apportionment affect not only how collective decisions are made and by whom, but also how and why a particular constitutional order develops over time. Recreating the American Republic provides a first and far-reaching analysis of when, how, and why these rules change and with what constitutional consequences. Recreating the American Republic reveals the special import of apportionment rules for pluralistic, democratic orders by engaging three critical eras and events of American history: the colonial era and the American Revolution; the early national years and the 1787 Constitutional Convention; and the nineteenth century and the American Civil War. This study revisits and systematically compares each seemingly familiar era and event--revealing new insights about each and a new metanarrative of American political development from 1700 to 1870. Recreating the American Republic will engage and challenge scholars and students of American history; political scientists and sociologists working within the analytical narrative, comparative, and historical-institutionalist methodological traditions; and political and legal theorists intrigued by questions of history, human order, consensual constitutionalism, the agency-structure antinomy, institutional change and representative governance.", "page_count": 488, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLAP4601-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-521-09455-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780521094559", "isbn10": "0521094550", "title": "A Grammar of the Arabic Language 2 volume set", "author": "['Carl Paul Caspari']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gpu8uyjN1tkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gpu8uyjN1tkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 135.0, "bookstore_used_price": 114.75, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "date": "1967-01-02", "description": "Dr Wright's translation of Caspari's Arabic Grammar has been thoroughly revised and enlarged.", "page_count": 767, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELI8703-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-521-13260-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780521132602", "isbn10": "0521132606", "title": "Latin America in Colonial Times", "author": "['Matthew Restall', 'Kris Lane']", "req_type": "Optional", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXKxMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXKxMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 37.99, "bookstore_used_price": 28.36, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "date": "2011-11-14", "description": "Few milestones in human history are as dramatic and momentous as the meeting of three great civilizations on American soil in the sixteenth century.

A shift in the balance of power - economic or military - weakens the foundations of the existing system, because those gaining power see the increasing benefits and the decreasing cost of changing the system. The result, maintains Gilpin, is that actors seek to alter the system through territorial, political, or economic expansion until the marginal costs of continuing change are greater than the marginal benefits.

The evidence demonstrates that the majority party seizes agenda control at nearly every stage of the legislative process in order to prevent bills that the party dislikes from reaching the floor.", "page_count": 352, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLAP7010-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-521-62724-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780521627245", "isbn10": "0521627249", "title": "Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800", "author": "['John Thornton']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AVZDHeVEeywC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AVZDHeVEeywC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 34.99, "bookstore_used_price": 26.24, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "date": "1998-04-28", "description": "This edition contains a new chapter extending the story into the eighteenth century.", "page_count": 340, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS5000-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-521-66960-X", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780521669603", "isbn10": "052166960X", "title": "Delegating Powers: A Transaction Cost Politics Approach to Policy Making Under Separate Powers", "author": "['David Epstein', \"Sharyn O'Halloran\"]", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kczTG_ftaC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kczTG_ftaC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 34.99, "bookstore_used_price": 34.5, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "date": "1999-11-13", "description": "In this path-breaking book, David Epstein and Sharyn O'Halloran produce the first unified theory of policy making between the legislative and executive branches.

For over two decades, it has enlightened students, scholars, and others with a thirst for knowledge about one of the world's great civilizations. This book is based on parts one and two of Lapidus' monumental A History of Islamic Societies, revised and updated, describes the transformations of Islamic societies from their beginning in the seventh century, through their diffusion across the globe, into the challenges of the nineteenth century. The story focuses on the organization of families and tribes, religious groups and states, depicts them in their varied and changing contexts, and shows how they were transformed by their interactions with other religious and political communities into a varied, global and interconnected family of societies. The book concludes with the European commercial and imperial interventions that initiated a new set of transformations in the Islamic world, and the onset of the modern era. Organized in narrative sections for the history of each major region, with innovative, analytic summary introductions and conclusions, this book is a unique endeavor. Its breadth, clarity, style, and thoughtful exposition will ensure its place in the classroom and beyond as a guide for the educated reader.", "page_count": 788, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELI2085-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-521-73553-X", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780521735537", "isbn10": "052173553X", "title": "the-cambridge-companion-to-the-sonnet-edited-by-a-d-cousins-and-peter-howarth", "author": "['Cousins', 'A.

Wiesel and Podwal guide you through the Haggadah and share their understanding and faith in a special illustrated edition that will be treasured for years to come. Accompanying the traditional Haggadah text (which appears here in an accessible new translation) are Elie Wiesel's poetic interpretations, reminiscences, and instructive retellings of ancient legends. The Nobel laureate interweaves past and present as the symbolism of the Seder is explored. Wiesel's commentaries may be read aloud in their entirety or selected passages may be read each year to illuminate the timeless message of this beloved book of redemption. This volume is enhanced by more than fifty original drawings by Mark Podwal, the artist whom Cynthia Ozick has called a \"genius of metaphor through line.\" Podwal's work not only complements the traditional Haggadah text, as well as Wiesel's poetic voice, but also serves as commentary unto itself. The drawings, with their fresh juxtapositions of insight and revelation, are an innovative contribution to the long tradition of Haggadah illustration.", "page_count": 144, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 2, "class_objects": ["RELJ3085-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-674-00211-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780674002111", "isbn10": "0674002113", "title": "Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America", "author": "['Ira Berlin']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1QeNngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1QeNngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 34.0, "bookstore_used_price": 23.24, "publisher": "Belknap Press", "date": "1998", "description": "Traces the development of Black society from the 1600s through the 1800s, describing the social conditions of both slaves and free Blacks", "page_count": 497, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["HIUS7559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-674-00511-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780674005112", "isbn10": "0674005112", "title": "Justice as Fairness: A Restatement", "author": "['John Rawls', 'Professor John Rawls']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ACyVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ACyVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 34.0, "bookstore_used_price": 25.37, "publisher": "Belknap Press", "date": "2001", "description": "This book originated as lectures for a course on political philosophy that Rawls taught regularly at Harvard in the 1980s.

As Rawls writes in the preface, the restatement presents \"in one place an account of justice as fairness as I now see it, drawing on all [my previous] works.\" He offers a broad overview of his main lines of thought and also explores specific issues never before addressed in any of his writings. Rawls is well aware that since the publication of A Theory of Justice in 1971, American society has moved farther away from the idea of justice as fairness. Yet his ideas retain their power and relevance to debates in a pluralistic society about the meaning and theoretical viability of liberalism.

It is Rawls's most detailed account of how a modern constitutional democracy, based on a liberal political conception, could and would be viewed as legitimate by reasonable citizens who on religious, philosophical, or moral grounds do not themselves accept a liberal comprehensive doctrine--such as that of Kant, or Mill, or Rawls's own \"Justice as Fairness,\" presented in A Theory of Justice (1971). The Law of Peoples extends the idea of a social contract to the Society of Peoples and lays out the general principles that can and should be accepted by both liberal and non-liberal societies as the standard for regulating their behavior toward one another. In particular, it draws a crucial distinction between basic human rights and the rights of each citizen of a liberal constitutional democracy.

They begin with the fearsome figure of Joseph Stalin, who was driven by the dual dream of a Communist revolution and a global empire. They reveal the scope and limits of Stalin's ambitions by taking us into the world of his closest subordinates, the ruthless and unimaginative foreign minister Molotov and the Party's chief propagandist, Zhdanov, a man brimming with hubris and missionary zeal. The authors expose the machinations of the much-feared secret police chief Beria and the party cadre manager Malenkov, who tried but failed to set Soviet policies on a different course after Stalin's death. Finally, they document the motives and actions of the self-made and self-confident Nikita Khrushchev, full of Russian pride and party dogma, who overturned many of Stalin's policies with bold strategizing on a global scale. The authors show how, despite such attempts to change Soviet diplomacy, Stalin's legacy continued to divide Germany and Europe, and led the Soviets to the split with Maoist China and to the Cuban missile crisis. Zubok and Pleshakov's groundbreaking work reveals how Soviet statesmen conceived and conducted their rivalry with the West within the context of their own domestic and global concerns and aspirations. The authors persuasively demonstrate that the Soviet leaders did not seek a conflict with the United States, yet failed to prevent it or bring it to conclusion. They also document why and how Kremlin policy-makers, cautious and scheming as they were, triggered the gravest crises of the Cold War in Korea, Berlin, and Cuba.

He illustrates these propositions by citing writers across the centuries from Alexis de Tocqueville to George Stigler, Herbert Spencer to Jay Forrester, Edmund Burke to Charles Murray.

Although reports of the massacre &#151; and photographs of its victims &#151; appeared in the United States, the Reagan administration quickly dismissed them as propaganda. In the end, El Mozote was forgotten. The war in El Salvador continued, with American funding.<br><br>When Mark Danner's reconstruction of these events first appeared in The New Yorker, it sent shock waves through the news media and the American foreign-policy establishment. Now Danner has expanded his report into a brilliant book, adding new material as well as the actual sources. He has produced a masterpiece of scrupulous investigative journalism that is also a testament to the forgotten victims of a neglected theater of the cold war. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Based in large part on his extensive account published in the December 6, 1993, issue of the New Yorker , National Magazine Award winner Danner's engrossing study reconstructs events that took place some dozen years before. In December 1981, over 750 men, women and children were killed in El Mozote, El Salvador, and the surrounding hamlets. Although at the time it was covered on the front pages of both the New York Times and the Washington Post , the reports were not enough to derail Ronald Reagan's push to prove that the El Salvadoran government was ``making a concerted and significant effort to comply with internationally recognized human rights.'' Why the government chose to ignore stories in the nation's two leading newspapers is one part of Danner's sad, well-researched book. The other is why El Mozote was attacked at all. Populated by evangelical Christians who, unlike Catholic neighbors fed on liberation theology, did not abet the rebel FMLN, the people of El Mozote believed they would be spared when the army decided to wipe out insurgents and their supporters.

Based on the venerable Richard Crawley translation, updated and revised for modern readers. The Landmark Thucydides includes a vast array of superbly designed and presented maps, brief informative appendices by outstanding classical scholars on subjects of special relevance to the text, explanatory marginal notes on each page, an index of unprecedented subtlety, and numerous other useful features.

Robert Gibbons addresses scholars in applied fields within economics who want a serious and thorough discussion of game theory but who may have found other works overly abstract. Gibbons emphasizes the economic applications of the theory at least as much as the pure theory itself; formal arguments about abstract games play a minor role. The applications illustrate the process of model building--of translating an informal description of a multi-person decision situation into a formal game-theoretic problem to be analyzed. Also, the variety of applications shows that similar issues arise in different areas of economics, and that the same game-theoretic tools can be applied in each setting. In order to emphasize the broad potential scope of the theory, conventional applications from industrial organization have been largely replaced by applications from labor, macro, and other applied fields in economics. The book covers four classes of games, and four corresponding notions of equilibrium: static games of complete information and Nash equilibrium, dynamic games of complete information and subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, static games of incomplete information and Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and dynamic games of incomplete information and perfect Bayesian equilibrium.", "page_count": 288, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ECON8010-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-691-01041-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691010410", "isbn10": "0691010412", "title": "Ruling The World", "author": "['Lloyd Gruber']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/10/9780691010410.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 52.5, "bookstore_used_price": 39.18, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "date": "2000", "description": "Lloyd Gruber.

Here John Ikenberry asks the question, what do states that win wars do with their newfound power and how do they use it to build order? In examining the postwar settlements in modern history, he argues that powerful countries do seek to build stable and cooperative relations, but the type of order that emerges hinges on their ability to make commitments and restrain power. The author explains that only with the spread of democracy in the twentieth century and the innovative use of international institutions--both linked to the emergence of the United States as a world power--has order been created that goes beyond balance of power politics to exhibit \"constitutional\" characteristics. The open character of the American polity and a web of multilateral institutions allow the United States to exercise strategic restraint and establish stable relations among the industrial democracies despite rapid shifts and extreme disparities in power. Blending comparative politics with international relations, and history with theory, After Victory will be of interest to anyone concerned with the organization of world order, the role of institutions in world politics, and the lessons of past postwar settlements for today.

Presenting important new findings, she offers the first empirical study to take up the question of representation from both sides of the constituent-representative relationship. The first half of the book examines whether black members of the U.S. House legislate and represent their constituents differently than white members do. Representation is broadly conceptualized to include not only legislators' roll call voting behavior and bill sponsorship, but also the symbolic acts in which they engage. The second half looks at the issue of representation from the perspective of ordinary African Americans based on a landmark national survey. Tate's findings are mixed. But, in the main, legislators' race does shape how they represent their constituents and how constituents evaluate them. African Americans view black representatives more positively than they do white representatives, even those who belong to their own political party. Black legislators, however, are just as likely as white representatives to sponsor and gain passage of bills in the House. Tate also concludes that black House members are more liberal as a group than are their black constituents, but that there is considerable divergence in the quality and type of representation they provide. The findings reported here will generate controversy in the fields of politics, law, and race, particularly as debate commences over renewing the Voting Rights Act, which is set to expire in 2007.", "page_count": 213, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["AAS1020-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-691-12254-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691122540", "isbn10": "0691122547", "title": "Food Fights Over Free Trade: How International Institutions Promote Agricultural Trade Liberalization", "author": "['Christina L.

The images made there in turn became critical to the work of black writers seeking to reinvent literary forms. Harlem Crossroads is the first book to examine their deep, sustained engagements with photographic practices. Arguing for Harlem as a crossroads between writers and the image, Sara Blair explores its power for canonical writers, whose work was profoundly responsive to the changing meanings and uses of photographs. She examines literary engagements with photography from the 1930s to the 1970s and beyond, among them the collaboration of Langston Hughes and Roy DeCarava, Richard Wright's uses of Farm Security Administration archives, James Baldwin's work with Richard Avedon, and Lorraine Hansberry's responses to civil rights images. Drawing on extensive archival work and featuring images never before published, Blair opens strikingly new views of the work of major literary figures, including Ralph Ellison's photography and its role in shaping his landmark novel Invisible Man, and Wright's uses of camera work to position himself as a modernist and postwar writer. Harlem Crossroads opens new possibilities for understanding the entangled histories of literature and the photograph, as it argues for the centrality of black writers to cultural experimentation throughout the twentieth century.", "page_count": 353, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["AMST8001-1", "ENGL8559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-691-14361-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691143613", "isbn10": "0691143617", "title": "Why Not Socialism?", "author": "['G.

Is it even possible? In this concise book, one of the world's leading political philosophers presents with clarity and wit a compelling moral case for socialism and argues that the obstacles in its way are exaggerated. There are times, G. A. Cohen notes, when we all behave like socialists. On a camping trip, for example, campers wouldn't dream of charging each other to use a soccer ball or for fish that they happened to catch. Campers do not give merely to get, but relate to each other in a spirit of equality and community. Would such socialist norms be desirable across society as a whole? Why not? Whole societies may differ from camping trips, but it is still attractive when people treat each other with the equal regard that such trips exhibit. But, however desirable it may be, many claim that socialism is impossible. Cohen writes that the biggest obstacle to socialism isn't, as often argued, intractable human selfishness--it's rather the lack of obvious means to harness the human generosity that is there. Lacking those means, we rely on the market. But there are many ways of confining the sway of the market: there are desirable changes that can move us toward a socialist society in which, to quote Albert Einstein, humanity has \"overcome and advanced beyond the predatory stage of human development.\"", "page_count": 96, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 3, "class_objects": ["PLPT1010-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-691-14743-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691147437", "isbn10": "0691147434", "title": "Clear And Simple As The Truth: Writing Classic Prose - Second Edition", "author": "['Francis-no\u00ebl Thomas', 'Mark Turner']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/37/9780691147437.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 28.95, "bookstore_used_price": 21.61, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "date": "2011", "description": "", "page_count": 272, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ENWR1510-66"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-691-14786-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691147864", "isbn10": "0691147868", "title": "Why Americans Hate the News Media and How It Matters", "author": "['Jonathan M.

Yet by the 1990s, this trust had all but evaporated. Why has confidence in the press declined so dramatically over the past 40 years? And has this change shaped the public's political behavior? This book examines waning public trust in the institutional news media within the context of the American political system and looks at how this lack of confidence has altered the ways people acquire political information and form electoral preferences. Jonathan Ladd argues that in the 1950s, '60s, and early '70s, competition in American party politics and the media industry reached historic lows. When competition later intensified in both of these realms, the public's distrust of the institutional media grew, leading the public to resist the mainstream press's information about policy outcomes and turn toward alternative partisan media outlets. As a result, public beliefs and voting behavior are now increasingly shaped by partisan predispositions. Ladd contends that it is not realistic or desirable to suppress party and media competition to the levels of the mid-twentieth century; rather, in the contemporary media environment, new ways to augment the public's knowledgeability and responsiveness must be explored. Drawing on historical evidence, experiments, and public opinion surveys, this book shows that in a world of endless news sources, citizens' trust in institutional media is more important than ever before.", "page_count": 270, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLAP3140-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-691-15262-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691152622", "isbn10": "0691152624", "title": "Justice and the Politics of Difference", "author": "['Iris Marion Young', 'Danielle S.

Young argues that by assuming a homogeneous public, democratic theorists fail to consider institutional arrangements for including people not culturally identified with white European male norms. Consequently, theorists do not adequately address the problem of an inclusive participatory framework. Basing her vision of the good society on the culturally plural networks of contemporary urban life, Young makes the case that normative theory and public policy should undermine group-based oppression by affirming rather than suppressing social group differences.

It is a question bound up with others--about freedom of speech, terror, violence, human rights, women's dress, and sexuality. Above all, it is tied to the possibility of democracy. In this fearless, original, and surprising book, Anne Norton demolishes the notion that there is a \"clash of civilizations\" between the West and Islam. What is really in question, she argues, is the West's commitment to its own ideals: to democracy and the Enlightenment trinity of liberty, equality, and fraternity. In the most fundamental sense, the Muslim question is about the values not of Islamic, but of Western, civilization. Moving between the United States and Europe, Norton provides a fresh perspective on iconic controversies, from the Danish cartoon of Muhammad to the murder of Theo van Gogh. She examines the arguments of a wide range of thinkers--from John Rawls to Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. And she describes vivid everyday examples of ordinary Muslims and non-Muslims who have accepted each other and built a common life together.

Using cutting-edge analysis, Christopher Loss recovers higher education's central importance to the larger social and political history of the United States in the twentieth century, and chronicles its transformation into a key mediating institution between citizens and the state. Framed around the three major federal higher education policies of the twentieth century--the 1944 GI Bill, the 1958 National Defense Education Act, and the 1965 Higher Education Act--the book charts the federal government's various efforts to deploy education to ready citizens for the national, bureaucratized, and increasingly global world in which they lived. Loss details the myriad ways in which academic leaders and students shaped, and were shaped by, the state's shifting political agenda as it moved from a preoccupation with economic security during the Great Depression, to national security during World War II and the Cold War, to securing the rights of African Americans, women, and other previously marginalized groups during the 1960s and '70s. Along the way, Loss reappraises the origins of higher education's current-day diversity regime, the growth of identity group politics, and the privatization of citizenship at the close of the twentieth century.

The New Keynesian framework is the workhorse for the analysis of monetary policy and its implications for inflation, economic fluctuations, and welfare. A backbone of the new generation of medium-scale models under development at major central banks and international policy institutions, the framework provides the theoretical underpinnings for the price stability\u2013oriented strategies adopted by most central banks in the industrialized world. Using a canonical version of the New Keynesian model as a reference, Jordi Gal\u00ed explores various issues pertaining to monetary policy's design, including optimal monetary policy and the desirability of simple policy rules. He analyzes several extensions of the baseline model, allowing for cost-push shocks, nominal wage rigidities, and open economy factors.

Only by removing Indian children from their homes for extended periods of time, policymakers reasoned, could white \"civilization\" take root while childhood memories of \"savagism\" gradually faded to the point of extinction. In the words of one official: \"Kill the Indian and save the man.\" Education for Extinction offers the first comprehensive account of this dispiriting effort. Much more than a study of federal Indian policy, this book vividly details the day-to-day experiences of Indian youth living in a \"total institution\" designed to reconstruct them both psychologically and culturally. The assault on identity came in many forms: the shearing off of braids, the assignment of new names, uniformed drill routines, humiliating punishments, relentless attacks on native religious beliefs, patriotic indoctrinations, suppression of tribal languages, Victorian gender rituals, football contests, and industrial training. Especially poignant is Adams's description of the ways in which students resisted or accommodated themselves to forced assimilation. Many converted to varying degrees, but others plotted escapes, committed arson, and devised ingenious strategies of passive resistance. Adams also argues that many of those who seemingly cooperated with the system were more than passive players in this drama, that the response of accommodation was not synonymous with cultural surrender. This is especially apparent in his analysis of students who returned to the reservation. He reveals the various ways in which graduates struggled to make sense of their lives and selectively drew upon their school experience in negotiating personal and tribal survival in a world increasingly dominated by white men. The discussion comes full circle when Adams reviews the government's gradual retreat from the assimilationist vision. Partly because of persistent student resistance, but also partly because of a complex and sometimes contradictory set of progressive, humanitarian, and racist motivations, policymakers did eventually come to view boarding schools less enthusiastically Based upon extensive use of government archives, Indian and teacher autobiographies, and school newspapers, Adams's moving account is essential reading for scholars and general readers alike interested in Western history, Native American studies, American race relations, education history, and multiculturalism.", "page_count": 396, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF7602-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-7178-0241-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780717802418", "isbn10": "0717802418", "title": "Manifesto Of The Communist Party Communist Manifesto Communist Manifesto", "author": "['Marx, Karl , 1818-1883']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/18/9780717802418.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 2.5, "bookstore_used_price": 2.24, "publisher": "International Publishers", "date": "2014", "description": "Bourgeois And Proletarians -- Proletarians And Communists -- Socialist And Communist Literature -- Reactionary Socialism -- Conservative Or Bourgeois Socialism -- Critical-utopian Socialism And Communism -- Position Of The Communists In Relation To The Various Existing Opposition Parties.

Phoenix was grown and raised among other genetic experiments in New York's Tower 7. She is an \"accelerated woman\"--only two years old but with the body and mind of an adult, Phoenix's abilities far exceed those of a normal human. Still innocent and inexperienced in the ways of the world, she is content living in her room speed reading e-books, running on her treadmill, and basking in the love of Saeed, another biologically altered human of Tower 7. Then one evening, Saeed witnesses something so terrible that he takes his own life. Devastated by his death and Tower 7's refusal to answer her questions, Phoenix finally begins to realize that her home is really her prison, and she becomes desperate to escape. But Phoenix's escape, and her destruction of Tower 7, is just the beginning of her story.

Valentino finds that ethnic hatreds or discrimination, undemocratic systems of government, and dysfunctions in society play a much smaller role in mass killing and genocide than is commonly assumed. He shows that the impetus for mass killing usually originates from a relatively small group of powerful leaders and is often carried out without the active support of broader society. Mass killing, in his view, is a brutal political or military strategy designed to accomplish leaders' most important objectives, counter threats to their power, and solve their most difficult problems. In order to capture the full scope of mass killing during the twentieth century, Valentino does not limit his analysis to violence directed against ethnic groups, or to the attempt to destroy victim groups as such, as do most previous studies of genocide. Rather, he defines mass killing broadly as the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants, using the criteria of 50,000 or more deaths within five years as a quantitative standard. Final Solutions focuses on three types of mass killing: communist mass killings like the ones carried out in the Soviet Union, China, and Cambodia; ethnic genocides as in Armenia, Nazi Germany, and Rwanda; and \"counter-guerrilla\" campaigns including the brutal civil war in Guatemala and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Valentino closes the book by arguing that attempts to prevent mass killing should focus on disarming and removing from power the leaders and small groups responsible for instigating and organizing the killing.", "page_count": 317, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 3, "class_objects": ["HIST2559-1", "PLCP3500-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8014-7407-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780801474071", "isbn10": "0801474078", "title": "The Ideological Origins of Great Power Politics, 1789-1989", "author": "['Mark L.

Mark L. Haas focuses on how ideology shapes perception. He does not delineate the content of particular ideologies, but rather the degree of difference among them. Degree of ideological difference is, he believes, the crucial factor as leaders decide which nations threaten and which bolster their state's security and their own domestic power. These threat perceptions will in turn impel leaders to make particular foreign-policy choices. Haas examines great-power relations in five periods: the 1790s in Europe, the Concert of Europe (1815\u20131848), the 1930s in Europe, Sino-Soviet relations from 1949 to 1960, and the end of the Cold War. In each case he finds a clear relationship between the degree of ideological differences that divided state leaders and those leaders' perceptions of threat level (and so of appropriate foreign-policy choices). These relationships held in most cases, regardless of the nature of the ideologies in question, the offense-defense balance, and changes in the international distribution of power.", "page_count": 232, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLIR8639-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8014-7474-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780801474743", "isbn10": "0801474744", "title": "The Good Wife's Guide (Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris): A Medieval Household Book", "author": "['Gina L.

The book was designed to teach this young wife the moral attributes, duties, and conduct befitting a woman of her station in society, in the almost certain event of her widowhood and subsequent remarriage. The work also provides a rich assembly of practical materials for the wife's use and for her household, including treatises on gardening and shopping, tips on choosing servants, directions on the medical care of horses and the training of hawks, plus menus for elaborate feasts, and more than 380 recipes. The Good Wife's Guide is the first complete modern English translation of this important medieval text also known as Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris (the Parisian household book), a work long recognized for its unique insights into the domestic life of the bourgeoisie during the later Middle Ages. The Good Wife's Guide, expertly rendered into modern English by Gina L. Greco and Christine M. Rose, is accompanied by an informative critical introduction setting the work in its proper medieval context as a conduct manual. This edition presents the book in its entirety, as it must have existed for its earliest readers. The Guide is now a treasure for the classroom, appealing to anyone studying medieval literature or history or considering the complex lives of medieval women. It illuminates the milieu and composition process of medieval authors and will in turn fascinate cooking or horticulture enthusiasts.

Yet a number of key questions about this tragedy remain unanswered: How did the violence spread from community to community and so rapidly engulf the nation? Why did individuals make decisions that led them to take up machetes against their neighbors? And what was the logic that drove the campaign of extermination? According to Scott Straus, a social scientist and former journalist in East Africa for several years (who received a Pulitzer Prize nomination for his reporting for the Houston Chronicle), many of the widely held beliefs about the causes and course of genocide in Rwanda are incomplete. They focus largely on the actions of the ruling elite or the inaction of the international community. Considerably less is known about how and why elite decisions became widespread exterminatory violence. Challenging the prevailing wisdom, Straus provides substantial new evidence about local patterns of violence, using original research-including the most comprehensive surveys yet undertaken among convicted perpetrators-to assess competing theories about the causes and dynamics of the genocide. Current interpretations stress three main causes for the genocide: ethnic identity, ideology, and mass-media indoctrination (in particular the influence of hate radio). Straus's research does not deny the importance of ethnicity, but he finds that it operated more as a background condition. Instead, Straus emphasizes fear and intra-ethnic intimidation as the primary drivers of the violence. A defensive civil war and the assassination of a president created a feeling of acute insecurity. Rwanda's unusually effective state was also central, as was the country's geography and population density, which limited the number of exit options for both victims and perpetrators. In conclusion, Straus steps back from the particulars of the Rwandan genocide to offer a new, dynamic model for understanding other instances of genocide in recent history-the Holocaust, Armenia, Cambodia, the Balkans-and assessing the future likelihood of such events.", "page_count": 296, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIST2559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8014-7611-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780801476112", "isbn10": "0801476119", "title": "Notes on Nightingale: The Influence and Legacy of a Nursing Icon", "author": "['Sioban Nelson', 'Anne Marie Rafferty']", "req_type": "Recommended", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=81cSYqzCpP8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=81cSYqzCpP8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 19.95, "bookstore_used_price": 9.79, "publisher": "Cornell University Press", "date": "2010", "description": "\"Notes on Nightingale is an extraordinary achievement, bringing together some of the world's most eminent Nightingale scholars.

She documents the efforts of African-American political leaders, intellectuals, and journalists who forcefully promoted anti-colonial politics and critiqued U.S. foreign policy. The eclipse of anti-colonial politics--which Von Eschen traces through African-American responses to the early Cold War, U.S. government prosecution of black American anti-colonial activists, and State Department initiatives in Africa--marked a change in the very meaning of race and racism in America from historical and international issues to psychological and domestic ones.

John M. Owen IV attributes this peculiar restraint to a synergy between liberal ideology and the institutions that exist within these states. Liberal elites identify their interests with those of their counterparts in foreign states, Owen contends. Free discussion and regular competitive elections allow the agitations of the elites in liberal democracies to shape foreign policy, especially during crises, by influencing governmental decision makers. Several previous analysts have offered theories to explain liberal peace, but they have not examined the state. This book explores the chain of events linking peace with democracies. Owen emphasizes that peace is constructed by democratic ideas, and should be understood as a strong tendency built upon historically contingent perceptions and institutions. He tests his theory against ten cases drawn from over a century of U.S. diplomatic history, beginning with the Jay Treaty in 1794 and ending with the Spanish-American War in 1898. A world full of liberal democracies would not necessarily be peaceful.

Not all such campaigns to win public support are successful; in some instances, foreign policy elites and the president and his advisors have to back off.

A number of Jewish families became prominent in commerce and public life there. Among the Jews of Fez of Hispanic origin was Samuel Pallache, who served the Moroccan sultan as a commercial and diplomatic agent in Holland until Pallache's death in 1616. Before that, he had tried to return with his family to Spain, and to this end he tried to convert to Catholicism and worked as an informer, intermediary, and spy in Moroccan affairs for the Spanish court. Later he became a privateer against Spanish ships and was tried in London for that reason. His religious identity proved to be as mutable as his political allegiances: when in Amsterdam, he was devoutly Jewish; when in Spain, a loyal converso (a baptized Jew). In A Man of Three Worlds, Mercedes Garc\u00eda-Arenal and Gerard Wiegers view Samuel Pallache's world as a microcosm of early modern society, one far more interconnected, cosmopolitan, and fluid than is often portrayed. Pallache's missions and misadventures took him from Islamic Fez and Catholic Spain to Protestant England and Holland. Through these travels, the authors explore the workings of the Moroccan sultanate and the Spanish court, the Jewish communities of Fez and Amsterdam, and details of the Atlantic-Mediterranean trade.

When religion becomes a zero-sum conceit--i.e., my religion is the only \"right\" path to God, therefore your religion is by definition \"wrong\"--Violence between peoples of different beliefs is the only natural outcome, argues Rabbi Sacks. But by looking anew at seminal biblical texts in the Book of Genesis--in which we find the foundational stories of all three Abrahamic faiths--Rabbi Sacks offers an entirely different understanding of God's multiple relationships: with Jacob, patriarch of Judaism; with Ishmael, patriarch of Islam; and with Esau, whose blessing is understood to confirm God's relationship with monotheists from other faiths and overarching relationship with all of humanity. By analyzing the texts that recount how Abraham's immediate descendants resolved their various sibling rivalries, Rabbi Sacks teaches us a powerful lesson in the existence of multiple pathways to God. \"We are not all the same,\" he declares. \"There is no one faith that encompasses the plenary truth of human wisdom ... The belief that one faith--ours--holds the key to salvation deserves to be challenged, not just because it has led to so much persecution and bloodshed in the name of God, but because it attempts to confine God to one religion, one way, one image of mankind. God cannot be so confined and remain the God of transcendence, the God-without-an-image who systematically defies our attempts to capture Him in categories of human understanding ... Making space for that which is other than myself is not a doctrine of religious relativism. It is, rather, the humility that says there are things I will not, cannot, understand and that I must leave to God.\" Rabbi Sacks's bold statement of our need to look with new eyes at specific scriptural passages from within each of the Abrahamic monotheisms--passages that, when interpreted literally, can lead to hatred, violence, and war--is an eloquent, clarion call for people of goodwill from all faiths to join together to end the misunderstandings that threaten to destroy us all.--Publisher description.", "page_count": 320, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 4, "class_objects": ["PLIR3500-1", "RELG3605-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8058-2819-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780805828191", "isbn10": "0805828192", "title": "Item Response Theory For Psychologists (multivariate Applications Series)", "author": "['Susan E.

Though existing scholarship shows that intraracial black violence did not reach high levels until after Reconstruction, contemporary records bear witness to its regular presence among enslaved populations. Slave against Slave explores the roots of and motivations for such violence and the ways in which slaves, masters, churches, and civil and criminal laws worked to hold it in check. Far from focusing on violence alone, Forret's work also adds depth to our understanding of morality among the enslaved, revealing how slaves sought to prevent violence and punish those who engaged in it. Forret mines a vast array of slave narratives, slaveholders' journals, travelers' accounts, and church and court records from across the South to approximate the prevalence of slave-against-slave violence prior to the Civil War. A diverse range of motives for these conflicts emerges, from tensions over status differences, to disagreements originating at work and in private, to discord relating to the slave economy and the web of debts that slaves owed one another, to courtship rivalries, marital disputes, and adulterous affairs. Forret also uncovers the role of explicitly gendered violence in bondpeople's constructions of masculinity and femininity, suggesting a system of honor among slaves that would have been familiar to southern white men and women, had they cared to acknowledge it. Though many generations of scholars have examined violence in the South as perpetrated by and against whites, the internal clashes within the slave quarters have remained largely unexplored. Forret's analysis of intraracial slave conflicts in the Old South examines narratives of violence in slave communities, opening a new line of inquiry into the study of American slavery.", "page_count": 544, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS5000-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8078-4221-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780807842218", "isbn10": "0807842214", "title": "The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935", "author": "['James D.

Melding social, cultural, and political history, Jane Dailey chronicles the Readjusters' efforts to foster political cooperation across the color line. She demonstrates that the power of racial rhetoric, and the divisiveness of racial politics, derived from the everyday experiences of individual Virginians_from their local encounters on the sidewalk, before the magistrate's bench, in the schoolroom. In the process, she reveals the power of black and white southerners to both create and resist new systems of racial discrimination. The story of the Readjusters shows how hard white southerners had to work to establish racial domination after emancipation, and how passionately black southerners fought each and every infringement of their rights as Americans.", "page_count": 278, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS3281-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8078-5659-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780807856598", "isbn10": "0807856592", "title": "When Sherman Marched North from the Sea: Resistance on the Confederate Home Front", "author": "['Jacqueline Glass Campbell']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nPXlseXYGcwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nPXlseXYGcwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 24.0, "bookstore_used_price": 17.91, "publisher": "Univ of North Carolina Press", "date": "2005-08-01", "description": "Home front and battle front merged in 1865 when General William T.

Before being called east in June 1862 to lead the Army of Virginia against General Robert E. Lee, he compiled an enviable record in Missouri and as commander of the Army of the Mississippi. After his ignominious defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run, he was sent to the frontier. Over the next twenty-four years Pope held important department commands on the western plains and was recognized as one of the army's leading authorities on Indian affairs, but he never again commanded troops in battle. In 1886, Pope was engaged by the National Tribune, a weekly newspaper published in Washington, D.C., to write a series of articles on his wartime experiences. Over the next five years, in twenty-nine installments, he wrote about the war as he had lived it. Collected here for the first time, Pope's \"war reminiscences\" join a select roster of memoirs written by Civil War army commanders. Pope presents a detailed review of the campaigns in which he participated and offers vivid character sketches of such illustrious figures as Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Clearly written and balanced in tone, his memoirs are a dramatic and important addition to the literature on the Civil War. Originally published in 1998.

Forensic accountants are often asked to provide litigation support where they are called on to give expert testimony about financial data and accounting activities. In other more proactive engagements, they probe situations using special investigative accounting skills and techniques. Some even see forensic accounting as practiced by skilled accounting specialists becoming part and parcel of most financial audits--an extra quality control step in the auditing process that will help reduce financial statement fraud.

It covers both litigation support and investigative accounting, examining the practical aspects of these two areas, as well as many of the newer technological areas. Forensic and Investigative Accounting explains and demonstrates how an effective forensic accountant needs a solid understanding of accounting, investigative auditing techniques, criminology, and courtroom procedures, as well as excellent communications skills, both written and oral.

This, the narrator tells us, is the real life of famous author Sebastian Knight, the inside story.

Yet the search proves to be a story quite as intriguing as any of Sebastian Knight's own books, as baffling, and, in the end, as uniquely rewarding.

While it is estimated that 25 percent or more of America's homeless are mentally ill, their lives are largely unknown to us. What must life be like for those who, in addition to living on the street, hear voices, suffer paranoid delusions, or have trouble thinking clearly or talking to others. Shelter Blues is an innovative portrait of people residing in Boston's Station Street Shelter. It examines the everyday lives of more than 40 homeless men and women, both white and African-American, ranging in age from early 20s to mid-60s. Based on a sixteen-month study, it draws readers into the personal worlds of these individuals and, by addressing the intimacies of homelessness, illness, and abjection, picks up where most scholarship and journalism stops. Robert Desjarlais works against the grain of media representations of homelessness by showing us not anonymous stereotypes but individuals. He draws on conversations as well as observations, talking with and listening to shelter residents to understand how they relate to their environment, to one another, and to those entrusted with their care. His book considers their lives in terms of a complex range of forces and helps us comprehend the linkages between culture, illness, personhood, and political agency on the margins of contemporary American society. Shelter Blues is unlike anything else ever written about homelessness. It challenges social scientists and mental health professionals to rethink their approaches to human subjectivity and helps us all to better understand one of the most pressing problems of our time.", "page_count": 307, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ANTH3290-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8129-7076-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780812970760", "isbn10": "0812970764", "title": "A Hero of Our Time", "author": "['\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432', 'Mikhail I\ufe20U\ufe21r\u02b9evich Lermontov']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QDaVx2wVKjkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QDaVx2wVKjkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.0, "bookstore_used_price": 7.46, "publisher": "Random House LLC", "date": "2004", "description": "I BELA I was traveling post from Tiflis.

The image of an estate presided over by a benevolent Thomas Jefferson has given way to a more complex view of Monticello as a working plantation, the success of which was made possible by the work of slaves. At the center of this transition has been the work of Lucia \"Cinder\" Stanton, recognized as the leading interpreter of Jefferson\u2019s life as a planter and master and of the lives of his slaves and their descendants. This volume represents the first attempt to pull together Stanton\u2019s most important writings on slavery at Monticello and beyond. Stanton\u2019s pioneering work deepened our understanding of Jefferson without demonizing him. But perhaps even more important is the light her writings have shed on the lives of the slaves at Monticello. Her detailed reconstruction for modern readers of slaves\u2019 lives vividly reveals their active roles in the creation of Monticello and a dynamic community previously unimagined. The essays collected here address a rich variety of topics, from family histories (including the Hemingses) to the temporary slave community at Jefferson\u2019s White House to stories of former slaves\u2019 lives after Monticello. Each piece is characterized by Stanton\u2019s deep knowledge of her subject and by her determination to do justice to both Jefferson and his slaves.

In such contexts, local environments such as after-school programs may help youth to mediate between social stereotypes and daily experience, or provide space for them to consider themselves as contributing members of a community. Based on four years of field work with both the adolescent members and staff of an inner-city youth organization in a large Midwestern city, Pride in the Projects examines the construction of identity as it occurs within this local context, emphasizing the relationships within which identities are formed. Drawing on research in psychology, sociology, education, and race and gender studies, the volume highlights the inadequacies in current identity development theories, expanding our understanding of the lives of urban teens and the ways in which interpersonal connections serve as powerful contexts for self-construction.

A former gang member and juvenile delinquent, Rios managed to escape the bleak outcome of many of his friends and earned a PhD at Berkeley and returned to his hometown to study how inner city young Latino and African American boys develop their sense of self in the midst of crime and intense policing. Punished examines the difficult lives of these young men, who now face punitive policies in their schools, communities, and a world where they are constantly policed and stigmatized. Rios followed a group of forty delinquent Black and Latino boys for three years. These boys found themselves in a vicious cycle, caught in a spiral of punishment and incarceration as they were harassed, profiled, watched, and disciplined at young ages, even before they had committed any crimes, eventually leading many of them to fulfill the destiny expected of them. But beyond a fatalistic account of these marginalized young men, Rios finds that the very system that criminalizes them and limits their opportunities, sparks resistance and a raised consciousness that motivates some to transform their lives and become productive citizens. Ultimately, he argues that by understanding the lives of the young men who are criminalized and pipelined through the criminal justice system, we can begin to develop empathic solutions which support these young men in their development and to eliminate the culture of punishment that has become an overbearing part of their everyday lives.", "page_count": 237, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["SOC2230-100", "SOC4230-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8147-9462-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780814794623", "isbn10": "0814794629", "title": "The Delectable Negro: Human Consumption and Homoeroticism Within US Slave Culture", "author": "['Vincent Woodard', 'Dwight McBride']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PScUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PScUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 27.0, "bookstore_used_price": 20.25, "publisher": "NYU Press", "date": "2014-06-27", "description": "Winner of the 2015 LGBT Studies Award presented by the Lambda Literary Foundation Scholars of US and transatlantic slavery have largely ignored or dismissed accusations that Black Americans were cannibalized.

The Delectable Negro explores these connections between homoeroticism, cannibalism, and cultures of consumption in the context of American literature and US slave culture. Utilizing many staples of African American literature and culture, such as the slave narratives of OlaudahEquiano, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass, as well as other less circulated materials like James L. Smith\u2019s slave narrative, runaway slave advertisements, and numerous articles from Black newspapers published in the nineteenth century, Woodard traces the racial assumptions, political aspirations, gender codes, and philosophical frameworks that dictated both European and white American arousal towards Black males and hunger for Black male flesh. Woodard uses these texts to unpack how slaves struggled not only against social consumption, but also against endemic mechanisms of starvation and hunger designed to break them. He concludes with an examination of the controversial chain gang oral sex scene in Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved, suggesting that even at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century, we are still at a loss for language with which to describe Black male hunger within a plantation culture of consumption.", "page_count": 320, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["AAS4725-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8147-9724-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780814797242", "isbn10": "0814797245", "title": "The Post-Soviet Wars: Rebellion, Ethnic Conflict, and Nationhood in the Caucasus", "author": "['Christoph Zurcher']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kNoVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kNoVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 28.0, "bookstore_used_price": 20.15, "publisher": "NYU Press", "date": "2009-09-01", "description": "Get ready for takeoff. The life of the flight attendant, a.k.a., stewardess, was supposedly once one of glamour, exotic travel and sexual freedom, as recently depicted in such films as Catch Me If You Can and View From the Top. The nostalgia for the beautiful, carefree and ever helpful stewardess perhaps reveals a yearning for simpler times, but nonetheless does not square with the difficult, demanding and sometimes dangerous job of today's flight attendants. Based on interviews with over sixty flight attendants, both female and male labor leaders, and and drawing upon his observations while flying across the country and overseas, Drew Whitelegg reveals a much more complicated profession, one that in many ways is the quintessential job of the modern age where life moves at record speeds and all that is solid seems up in the air. Containing lively portraits of flight attendants, both current and retired, this book is the first to show the intimate, illuminating, funny, and sometimes dangerous behind-the-scenes stories of daily life for the flight attendant. Going behind the curtain, Whitelegg ventures into first-class, coach, the cabin, and life on call for these men and women who spend week in and week out in foreign cities, sleeping in hotel rooms miles from home. Working the Skies also elucidates the contemporary work and labor issues that confront the modern worker: the demands of full-time work and parenthood; the downsizing of corporate America and the resulting labor lockouts; decreasing wages and hours worked; job insecurity; and the emotional toll of a high stress job. Given the events of 9/11, flight attendants now have an especially poignant set of stressful concerns to manage, both for their own safety as well as for those they serve, the passengers. Flight attendants, originally registered nurses charged with attending to passengers' medical needs, now find themselves wearing the hats of therapist, security guard and undercover agent.

Although the term gridlock is said to have entered the American political lexicon after the 1980 elections, legislative stalemate is not a modern invention. Alexander Hamilton complained about it more than two centuries ago.In Stalemate, Sarah Binder examines the causes and consequences of gridlock, exploring the ways in which elections and institutions together limit the capacity of Congress and the president to make public law.Binder illuminates the historical ups and downs of policy stalemate by developing an empirical measure to assess the frequency of gridlock each Congress since World War II. Her analysis weaves together the effects of institutions and elections, and shows how both intra-branch and inter-branch conflict shape legislative performance.Binder also explores the consequences of legislative gridlock, assessing whether and to what degree it affects electoral fortunes, political ambitions, and institutional reputations of legislators and presidents alike. The results illuminate what she calls the dilemma of gridlock: Despite ample evidence of gridlocks institutional consequences, legislators lack sufficient electoral incentive to do much about it.Binder concludes that, absent a sufficient motivation for legislators to overcome the dilemma of gridlock and to redress the excesses of stalemate, legislative deadlock is likely to be a recurring and enduring feature of the landscape of national politics and policymaking.By putting conclusions about the politics of gridlock on a more sure-footed empirical basis, this systematic account will encourage scholars and political observers to rethink the causes and consequence of legislative stalemate.", "page_count": 202, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLAP7010-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8166-2298-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780816622986", "isbn10": "0816622981", "title": "The Morals of History", "author": "['Tzvetan Todorov']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fDU4BLtW7EQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fDU4BLtW7EQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 34.0, "bookstore_used_price": 25.5, "publisher": "U of Minnesota Press", "date": "1995", "description": "The celebrated theorist Tzvetan Todorov offers here a thought provoking study of the complex relationship between 'ethics' and 'history'.

Yet a definition of deaf people based on hearing loss obscures a wealth of ways in which societies have benefited from the significant contributions of deaf people. In this bold intervention into ongoing debates about disability and what it means to be human, experts from a variety of disciplines--neuroscience, linguistics, bioethics, history, cultural studies, education, public policy, art, and architecture--advance the concept of Deaf Gain and challenge assumptions about what is normal. Through their in-depth articulation of Deaf Gain, the editors and authors of this pathbreaking volume approach deafness as a distinct way of being in the world, one which opens up perceptions, perspectives, and insights that are less common to the majority of hearing persons. For example, deaf individuals tend to have unique capabilities in spatial and facial recognition, peripheral processing, and the detection of images. And users of sign language, which neuroscientists have shown to be biologically equivalent to speech, contribute toward a robust range of creative expression and understanding. By framing deafness in terms of its intellectual, creative, and cultural benefits, Deaf Gain recognizes physical and cognitive difference as a vital aspect of human diversity.

The second half addresses the problems of living with technology. Ferr\u00e9 contrasts Karl Marx's and Buckminster Fuller's \"bright\" visions of technology and modern existence with the \"somber\" visions of Martin Heidegger and Herbert Marcuse. Next, in offering direction for an ethical assessment of technology, Ferr\u00e9 poses questions about workplace automation, computers, nuclear energy, Third World development, and genetic engineering. Finally, the book considers debates about the mutual influences between technology and religion, and technology and metaphysics. A glossary and a list of suggested further readings are included. Providing a philosophical framework that will remain timely in the face of rapid technological change, Philosophy of Technology will help students in both the sciences and liberal arts to examine comprehensively their own and society's fundamental beliefs and attitudes about technology.", "page_count": 149, "google_rating": 2.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["ISBU3888-101", "ISSS3888-101"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8203-4540-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780820345406", "isbn10": "0820345407", "title": "Becoming Confederates: Paths To A New National Loyalty Project Muse Upcc Books", "author": "['Gallagher, Gary W.']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/06/9780820345406.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 20.95, "bookstore_used_price": 15.64, "publisher": "The University Of Georgia Press,", "date": "2013", "description": "Conduct Must Conform To The New Order Of Things: R.e.

Drawing on subaltern postcolonial studies and Marxism, he directs critical attention to the peripheries, where figures including Chinese coolies, Japanese pimps, trafficked Japanese women, and Korean tenant farmers supplied the vital energy that drove Japan's empire. He identifies three phases of Japan's capitalist expansion, each powered by distinct modes of capturing and expropriating life and labor: biopolitics (1895\u20131914), neuropolitics (1920\u201332), and necropolitics (1935-45). During the first phase, Japanese elites harnessed the labor of marginalized subjects as Japan colonized Taiwan, Korea, and south Manchuria, and sent hustlers and sex workers into China to expand its market hegemony. Linking the deformed bodies laboring in the peripheries with the \"erotic-grotesque\" media in the metropole, Driscoll centers the second phase on commercial sexology, pornography, and detective stories in Tokyo to argue that by 1930, capitalism had colonized all aspects of human life: not just labor practices but also consumers\u2019 attention and leisure time. Focusing on Japan's Manchukuo colony in the third phase, he shows what happens to the central figures of biopolitics as they are subsumed under necropolitical capitalism: coolies become forced laborers, pimps turn into state officials and authorized narcotraffickers, and sex workers become \"comfort women\". Driscoll concludes by discussing Chinese fiction written inside Manchukuo, describing the everyday violence unleashed by necropolitics.", "page_count": 384, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIEA3172-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8223-4777-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780822347774", "isbn10": "0822347776", "title": "Thiefing Sugar: Eroticism Between Women In Caribbean Literature", "author": "[\"Tinsley, Omise'eke Natasha , 1971-\"]", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/74/9780822347774.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 25.95, "bookstore_used_price": 20.12, "publisher": "Duke University Press", "date": "2010", "description": "Introduction : The Spring Of Her Look -- Rose Is My Mama, Stanfaste Is My Papa : Hybrid Landscapes And Sexualities In Surinamese Women's Oral Poetry -- Darkening The Lily : The Erotics Of Self-making In Eliot Bliss's Luminous Isle -- Blue Countries, Dark Beauty : Opaque Desires In The Poetry Of Ida Faubert -- At The River Of Washerwomen : Work, Water, And Sexual Fluidity In Mayotte Cap\u00e9cia's I Am A Martinican Woman -- Transforming Sugar, Transitioning Revolution : Male Womanhood And Lesbian Eroticism In Michelle Cliff's No Telephone To Heaven -- Breaking Hard Against Things : Crossing Between Sexual And Revolutionary Politics In Dionne Brand's No Language Is Neutral.

It identifies the care delivered during various disasters; explicates how nurses at the local level intersected with the American Red Cross (ARC), American Nurses Association (ANA), the U.S. Public Health Service, and other federal/state organizations; describes how this intersection changed over time; and analyzes how issues of race, class, and gender influenced the ways nurses and other health care professionals responded to disasters. In each disaster, the safeguards developed, such as urban fire departments and hospitals, were overwhelmed. At the same time, these disasters (see TOC) prompted health care workers, survivors, and civic and private organizations to reflect on the character and speed of responders as documented in letters, memoirs, oral histories, newspaper stories, and professional publications. This book, while asserting that nurses and other health care workers sought to restore stability in the aftermath of a chaotic event, also illustrates how such events can temporarily unravel stable gendered, social, racial, and geographical boundaries while informing and changing professional attitudes to, and standards of, practice. Nine disasters, from the Galveston hurricane of 1900 to the Coconut Grove nightclub fire to 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, are discussed. Key Features Presents new and revised commentary on nursing's response to key disasters in the US and Canada over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries Captures important disaster episodes in the development of professional nursing Provides perspectives on disaster relief for nursing and women's issues research Discusses interventions in light of racial, ethnic, gender, and professional contexts Advances the importance of disaster responses that are evidence based Integrates witnessing from letters, memoirs, oral histories, newspaper stories, and professional publications with historical analysis", "page_count": 291, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["USEM1570-4"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8261-1023-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780826110237", "isbn10": "0826110231", "title": "Career Counseling in P-12 Schools", "author": "['Jennifer Curry, PhD', 'Amy Milsom, DEd']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NXtuAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NXtuAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 70.0, "bookstore_used_price": 52.24, "publisher": "Springer Publishing Company", "date": "2013-08-12", "description": "Print+CourseSmart", "page_count": 350, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDHS7220-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8261-2527-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780826125279", "isbn10": "0826125271", "title": "Jonas And Kovner's Health Care Delivery In The United States, 11th Edition", "author": "['Knickman, James R.', 'Kovner, Anthony R.', 'Jonas, Steven']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/79/9780826125279.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 95.0, "bookstore_used_price": 47.22, "publisher": "Springer Publishing Company", "date": "2015", "description": "", "page_count": 424, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PHS7200-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "0-8261-2544-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780826125446", "isbn10": "0826125441", "title": "Expertise in Nursing Practice, Second Edition: Caring, Clinical Judgment, and Ethics", "author": "['Patricia E.

The second half of the critique concentrates on the apparent teleology in nature's design of organisms. Kant argues that our minds are inclined to see purpose and order in nature and this is the main principle underlying all of our judgements.

It encourages readers to shift their focus away from ineffective, harmful weight-loss efforts towards improving and sustaining positive self-care behaviors.

Embody guides readers step-by-step through the five core competencies of the Body Positive's model: Reclaim Health, Practice Intuitive Self-Care, Cultivate Self-Love, Declare Your Own Authentic Beauty, and Build Community. These competencies are fundamental skills anyone can practice on a daily basis to honor their innate wisdom and take good care of their whole selves because they are motivated by self-love and appreciation.

This book explores how disparity structures international relationships. Beginning at the bilateral level, the relationship between the smaller side and the larger side can be normal as long as the smaller does not feel threatened and the larger can assume that its capabilities are respected. However, the smaller can be tempted to brinksmanship, while the larger can be tempted to bully. Asymmetric conflicts are often stalemated because the limited commitment of the larger side is met by the smaller's mortal resistance. In multilateral situations, asymmetry shapes patterns of uncertainty and attention. In global systems, how hegemons treat their subjects is the unobserved sand shifting beneath their feet as they look toward their challenger.

Today, new technologies make it possible to roam instantly and experimentally across musical languages and generations, from Detroit techno to jam bands to baroque opera\u2014or to dive deeper into the set of tastes that we already have. Either way, we can listen to nearly anything, at any time. The possibilities in this new age of listening overturn old assumptions about what it means to properly appreciate music\u2014to be an \u201ceducated\u201d listener. In Every Song Ever, the veteran New York Times music critic Ben Ratliff reimagines the very idea of music appreciation for our times. As familiar subdivisions like \u201crock\u201d and \u201cjazz\u201d matter less and less and music\u2019s accessible past becomes longer and broader, listeners can put aside the intentions of composers and musicians and engage music afresh, on their own terms. Ratliff isolates signal musical traits\u2014such as repetition, speed, and virtuosity\u2014and traces them across wildly diverse recordings to reveal unexpected connections. When we listen for slowness, for instance, we may detect surprising affinities between the drone metal of Sunn O))), the mixtape manipulations of DJ Screw, Sarah Vaughan singing \u201cLover Man,\u201d and the final works of Shostakovich. And if we listen for closeness, we might notice how the tight harmonies of bluegrass vocals illuminate the virtuosic synchrony of John Coltrane\u2019s quartet. Ratliff also goes in search of \u201cthe perfect moment\u201d; considers what it means to hear emotion by sampling the complex sadness that powers the music of Nick Drake and Slayer; and examines the meaning of certain common behaviors, such as the impulse to document and possess the entire performance history of the Grateful Dead. Encompassing the sounds of five continents and several centuries, Ratliff\u2019s book is an artful work of criticism and a lesson in open-mindedness. It is a definitive field guide to our radically altered musical habitat.", "page_count": 272, "google_rating": 2.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["MUSI3050-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-250-11873-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781250118738", "isbn10": "1250118735", "title": "City Of Thorns: Nine Lives In The World's Largest Refugee Camp", "author": "['Ben Rawlence']", "req_type": "Recommended", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/38/9781250118738.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 18.0, "bookstore_used_price": 8.96, "publisher": "Picador", "date": "2017", "description": "", "page_count": 400, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["LPPS3295-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-259-27717-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781259277177", "isbn10": "1259277178", "title": "Investments", "author": "['Alan J.

These online and storefront institutions lure students with promises of fast degrees and \"guaranteed\" job placement, but what they deliver is often something quite different. In this provocative history of for-profit higher education, historian and educational researcher A. J. Angulo tells the remarkable and often sordid story of these \"diploma mills,\" which target low-income and nontraditional students while scooping up a disproportionate amount of federal student aid. Tapping into a little-known history with big implications, Angulo takes readers on a lively journey that begins with the apprenticeship system of colonial America and ends with today\u2019s politically savvy $35 billion multinational for-profit industry. He traces the transformation of nineteenth-century reading and writing schools into \"commercial\" and \"business\" colleges, explores the early twentieth century\u2019s move toward professionalization and progressivism, and explains why the GI Bill prompted a surge of new for-profit institutions. He also shows how well-founded concerns about profit-seeking in higher education have evolved over the centuries and argues that financial gaming and maneuvering by these institutions threatens to destabilize the entire federal student aid program. This is the first sweeping narrative history to explain why for-profits have mattered to students, taxpayers, lawmakers, and the many others who have viewed higher education as part of the American dream. Diploma Mills speaks to today\u2019s concerns by shedding light on unmistakable conflicts of interest long associated with this scandal-plagued class of colleges and universities.", "page_count": 224, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF7602-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-4214-2321-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781421423210", "isbn10": "1421423219", "title": "Democracy's Schools: The Rise of Public Education in America", "author": "['Johann N.

Neem tells the inspiring story of how and why Americans built a robust public school system in the decades between the Revolution and the Civil War. It\u2019s a story in which ordinary people in towns across the country worked together to form districts and build schoolhouses and reformers sought to expand tax support and give every child a liberal education. By the time of the Civil War, most northern states had made common schools free, and many southern states were heading in the same direction. Americans made schooling a public good. Yet back then, like today, Americans disagreed over the kind of education needed, who should pay for it, and how schools should be governed. Neem explores the history and meaning of these disagreements. As Americans debated, teachers and students went about the daily work of teaching and learning. Neem takes us into the classrooms of yore so that we may experience public schools from the perspective of the people whose daily lives were most affected by them. Ultimately, Neem concludes, public schools encouraged a diverse people to see themselves as one nation. By studying the origins of America\u2019s public schools, Neem urges us to focus on the defining features of democratic education: promoting equality, nurturing human beings, preparing citizens, and fostering civic solidarity.", "page_count": 256, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF7602-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-4221-6803-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781422168035", "isbn10": "1422168034", "title": "Primal Leadership: Unleashing the Power of Emotional Intelligence", "author": "['Daniel Goleman', 'Richard E.

However, most debate-style readers do a disservice to students by selecting readings from disparate sources that end up talking past one another. As a part of the Debating Politics series from CQ Press, this reader is different. Featuring paired pron pieces written specifically for this volume, Debating Terrorism encourages students to actively grapple with the central debates and questions surrounding the subject of terrorism and counterterrorism . With topics ranging from the root causes of terrorism, the role of religion in terrorism, whether suicide terrorism is ever justified, whether the spread of democracy can help defeat terrorism, and what trade-offs, if any, should exist between security and civil liberties, Gottlieb\ufffds outstanding cast of contributors returns in this edition, compelling students to wrestle with the conflicting perspectives that define the field. Gottlieb frames the complexity and sophistication of these issues with incisive chapter headnotes providing students with the requisite context and preparing them to read each argument critically, allowing them to understand the past, present, and future of terrorism and counterterrorism. Each of the selections has been thoroughly updated to account for recent world events, policy changes, and new scholarship.

The remarkable vicar, Walter Hussey, was a great patron of the arts. His vision for St. Matthew's and later for Chichester Cathedral, where he moved to become Dean, is one of the most fascinating stories in the history of the Anglican Church in the last century.Britten called his work a Festival Cantata and it is structured with choral and solo movements. The text by the supposedly mad Christopher Smart (1722-1771) is part of a poem called Jubilate Agno which he composed in a mental asylum having been committed there by his father-in-law for apparent religious mania. He died in a debtors' prison. It was W.H. Auden who brought the poem to Britten's attention. It is easy to see why Britten was so attracted to Smart's poem. It has great colour, drama, bizarre imagery, and the central issue of the individual against the crowd, or against authority, was one to which Britten was to return repeatedly in his works. Britten had developed a deep interest in Purcell's music at this time and had made keyboard realisations of accompaniments for a number of songs which he performed with Peter Pears. Purcell's influence can easily be heard in the Hallelujah sections. The challenges in this work are many and varied though the difficulty level is not great overall. It is an ideal concert work and is popular with performers and audiences alike. Practical issues include really quiet singing while projecting the voice at the start; dealing with the rhythmic complexities of the first quick section ('Let Nimrod the mighty hunter') and getting the most out of the words and the dynamic contrasts here; the unanimity of the dotted rhythms in the Hallelujah sections; the fielding of four soloists who can put across the character of these zany movements (the cat, the mouse, flowers); the realisation of the depth of passion in the 'For I am under the same accusation as my Saviour' section; the brilliance of the final quick section with all the bizarre musical instrument rhymes; and finally realising the 'stillness and serenity' of the slow music before the final Hallelujah. There is much to consider and much devil in the detail. However, the work is emphatically worth any amount of effort to realise Britten's inspiration.

More often than not, Wenger demonstrates, religious freedom talk worked to privilege the dominant white Christian population. At the same time, a diverse array of minority groups at home and colonized people abroad invoked and reinterpreted this ideal to defend themselves and their ways of life. In so doing they posed sharp challenges to the racial and religious exclusions of American life. People of almost every religious stripe have argued, debated, negotiated, and brought into being an ideal called American religious freedom, subtly transforming their own identities and traditions in the process.

Drawing on an extraordinary survey of slave refugee camps throughout the country, Embattled Freedom reveals as never before the everyday experiences of these refugees from slavery as they made their way through the vast landscape of army-supervised camps that emerged during the war. Amy Murrell Taylor vividly reconstructs the human world of wartime emancipation, taking readers inside military-issued tents and makeshift towns, through commissary warehouses and active combat, and into the realities of individuals and families struggling to survive physically as well as spiritually. Narrating their journeys in and out of the confines of the camps, Taylor shows in often gripping detail how the most basic necessities of life were elemental to a former slave's quest for freedom and full citizenship. The stories of individuals--storekeepers, a laundress, and a minister among them--anchor this ambitious and wide-ranging history and demonstrate with new clarity how contingent the slaves' pursuit of freedom was on the rhythms and culture of military life.

Leading Durkheim scholar Steve Lukes's new introduction builds upon Lewis Coser's original -- which places the work in its intellectual and historical context and pinpoints its central ideas and arguments -- by focusing on the text's significance for how we ought to think sociologically about some central problems that face us today.\"--back cover.", "page_count": 416, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 2, "class_objects": ["PLCP2420-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-4798-0689-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781479806898", "isbn10": "1479806897", "title": "The Counter-Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America", "author": "['Gerald Horne']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NYjtCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NYjtCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 25.0, "bookstore_used_price": 16.42, "publisher": "NYU Press", "date": "2016-09-01", "description": "The successful 1776 revolt against British rule in North America has been hailed almost universally as a great step forward for humanity. But the Africans then living in the colonies overwhelmingly sided with the British. In this trailblazing book, Gerald Horne shows that in the prelude to 1776, the abolition of slavery seemed all but inevitable in London, delighting Africans as much as it outraged slaveholders, and sparking the colonial revolt. Prior to 1776, anti-slavery sentiments were deepening throughout Britain and in the Caribbean, rebellious Africans were in revolt. For European colonists in America, the major threat to their security was a foreign invasion combined with an insurrection of the enslaved. It was a real and threatening possibility that London would impose abolition throughout the colonies\u2014a possibility the founding fathers feared would bring slave rebellions to their shores. To forestall it, they went to war. The so-called Revolutionary War, Horne writes, was in part a counter-revolution, a conservative movement that the founding fathers fought in order to preserve their right to enslave others. The Counter-Revolution of 1776 brings us to a radical new understanding of the traditional heroic creation myth of the United States.", "page_count": 363, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["AAS5559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-4798-4938-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781479849383", "isbn10": "1479849383", "title": "Disability Media Studies", "author": "['Elizabeth Ellcessor', 'Bill Kirkpatrick']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FN0yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FN0yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 35.0, "bookstore_used_price": 26.12, "publisher": "NYU Press", "date": "2017-10-03", "description": "Introduces key ideas and offers a sense of the new frontiers and questions in the emerging field of disability media studies Disability Media Studies articulates the formation of a new field of study, based in the rich traditions of media, cultural, and disability studies.

The book provides a comprehensive overview for anyone interested in the study of disability and media today. Case studies include familiar contemporary examples\u2014such as Iron Man 3, Lady Gaga, and Oscar Pistorius\u2014as well as historical media, independent disability media, reality television, and media technologies. The contributors consider disability representation, the role of media in forming cultural assumptions about ability, the construction of disability via media technologies, and how disabled audiences respond to particular media artifacts. The volume concludes with afterwords from two different perspectives on the field\u2014one by disability scholar Rachel Adams, the other by media scholars Mara Mills and Jonathan Sterne\u2014that reflect upon the collection, the ongoing conversations, and the future of disability media studies.

Known for his conversational writing style, author Andrew Pennock offers step-by-step instructions on how to write for a variety of genres in a style that policy makers expect. Focusing on an audience-centered approach, you will first learn how to create and organize an argument based on the unique needs and expectations of policy makers. The book then moves onto the nuts and bolts of how to write for a policy audience, with special consideration of ethics and working with visual and technical material. Finally, the book provides practical guidance on writing in specific policy genres: policy memos, briefs, Op-Eds, press releases, written testimony, social media, and emails. Key Features: Basic policy writing tasks help you write sentences, paragraphs and sections that make sense to readers (and to professors!). You will also learn how to create professional quality tables and figures that support your argument as well as how to package these components together effectively to communicate with policy makers. Six separate chapters for various public policy genres (issue briefs, legislative histories, decision memos, testimony, op-eds, and new media) provide you with an overview of the genre, several examples, and an analysis of each example. Current examples from across the field of public policy keep you engaged by connecting the concepts to current topics such as public health (the opioid epidemic, Native-American healthcare, lead poisoning), education (early childhood, school governance), criminal justice (sexting laws, ban-the-box), business regulation (AirBnB, renewable energy, drug pricing), security policy (cyber-security, foreign asset control), and social policy (physician assisted suicide).", "page_count": 280, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["LPPL6050-ALL"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-5084-9366-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781508493662", "isbn10": "1508493669", "title": "Moonlight On The Avenue Of Faith: A Novel", "author": "['Gina B.

Whether or not America itself declines or thrives under President Trump's leadership, the post-war liberal international order underpinned by US military, economic and ideological primacy and supported by global institutions serving its power and purpose, is coming to an end. But what will take its place? A Chinese world order? A re-constituted form of American hegemony? A regionalized system of global cooperation, including major and emerging powers? In this updated and extended edition of his widely acclaimed book, Amitav Acharya offers an incisive answer to this fundamental question. While the US will remain a major force in world affairs, he argues that it has lost the ability to shape world order after its own interests and image. As a result, the US will be one of a number of anchors including emerging powers, regional forces, and a concert of the old and new powers shaping a new world order. Rejecting labels such as multipolar, apolar, or G-Zero, Acharya likens the emerging system to a multiplex theatre, offering a choice of plots (ideas), directors (power), and action (leadership) under one roof. Finally, he reflects on the policies that the US, emerging powers and regional actors must pursue to promote stability in this decentred but interdependent, multiplex world.

In Section 1, students are introduced to the microskills framework and its multicultural orientation, and the importance of listening to draw out client stories, issues, and concerns is emphasized. This part also presents two strategies to facilitate practitioners learning and analysis of client interviews: the community genogram and the client change scale. Section 2 presents the specifics of particular influencing skills, including focusing, supportive confrontation, feedback and self-disclosure, and interpretation/reframing. In Section 3, students gain an understanding of how to integrate and apply learned skillsets. They are introduced to the 5-Stage Interview, a framework that effectively applies the concepts addressed throughout the book to multiple counseling theories. The fourth edition includes clear behavioral skill descriptions to enable the interviewer to anticipate client responses as well as outcomes; concrete attention to multicultural practice and social justice; and introduction of the community genogram. Featuring foundational skillsets that are critical to the counseling practice, Basic Influencing Skills and Strategies is an ideal text for introductory courses in counseling.

Yet it would be another twenty years before they would experience something akin to the national fame and recognition that African American men had known since the 1930s, the days of Joe Louis and Jesse Owens. From the 1920s, when black women athletes were confined to competing within the black community, through the heady days of the late twentieth century when they ruled the world of women's track and field, African American women found sport opened the door to a better life. However, they also discovered that success meant challenging perceptions that many Americans--both black and white--held of them. Through the stories of six athletes--Coachman, Ora Washington, Althea Gibson, Wilma Rudloph, Wyomia Tyus, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee--Jennifer H. Lansbury deftly follows the emergence of black women athletes from the African American community; their confrontations with contemporary attitudes of race, class, and gender; and their encounters with the civil rights movement.

Why and how they did so and to what effect are the themes of this history of the nomadic tribes of Inner Asia - the Mongols, Turks, Uighurs and others, collectively dubbed the Barbarians by the Chinese and the Europeans. This two-thousand year history of the nomadic tribes is drawn from a wide range of sources and told with unprecedented clarity and pace. The author shows that to describe the tribes as barbaric is seriously to underestimate their complexity and underlying social stability. He argues that their relationship with the Chinese was as much symbiotic as parasitic and that they understood their dependence on a strong and settled Chinese state. He makes sense of the apparently random rise and fall of these mysterious, obscure and fascinating nomad confederacies.", "page_count": 325, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["HIEA3162-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-55861-436-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781558614369", "isbn10": "1558614362", "title": "Still Alive: A Holocaust Girlhood Remembered", "author": "['Ruth Kl\u00fcger']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XH5wh9XVBOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XH5wh9XVBOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.95, "bookstore_used_price": 11.91, "publisher": "Feminist Press at CUNY", "date": "2003", "description": "Now in paperback, the acclaimed Holocaust memoir declared \"a book of breathtaking honesty and extraordinary insight.\"--LA Times", "page_count": 216, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["SOC4559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-55861-489-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781558614895", "isbn10": "1558614893", "title": "Baghdad Burning: Girl Blog from Iraq", "author": "['Alia Mamdouh', '\u02bb\u0100liyah Mamd\u016b\u1e25', 'Riverbend']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_WGVGa-8IcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_WGVGa-8IcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 14.95, "bookstore_used_price": 8.93, "publisher": "Feminist Press at CUNY", "date": "2005", "description": "Presents the Internet weblog entries of a young Iraqi woman living in Baghdad as she chronicles the hardships and complexities of daily life and the political intricacies during the first year after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.", "page_count": 286, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 3, "class_objects": ["PAVS4500-5"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-55861-753-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781558617537", "isbn10": "1558617531", "title": "Women Without Men: A Novel of Modern Iran", "author": "['Shahrnush Parsipur']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=er5kfDqrX3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=er5kfDqrX3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.95, "bookstore_used_price": 7.94, "publisher": "The Feminist Press at CUNY", "date": "2012-01-10", "description": "A modern literary masterpiece, Women Without Men creates an evocative and powerfully drawn allegory of life in contemporary Iran.

Encompassing everything from urban trail corridors to river floodplains to wilderness-like linkages, greenways preserve or improve the integrity of the landscape, not only by stemming the loss of natural features, but also by engendering new natural and social functions. From 19th-century parks and parkways to projects still on the drawing boards, Designing Greenways is a fascinating introduction to the possibilities-and pitfalls-involved in these ambitious projects.

The book: documents the broad range of benefits, including economic impacts, resulting from comprehensive biodiversity protection efforts; identifies and disseminates information on replicable best community practices; establishes benchmarks for evaluating community biodiversity protection programs. Nine comprehensive case studies of communities explain how nature protection programs have been implemented. From Austin and Baltimore to Tucson and Minneapolis, the authors explore how different cities and counties have taken bold steps to successfully protect natural areas. Examining program structure and administration, land acquisition strategies and sources of funding, habitat restoration programs, social impacts, education efforts, and overall results, these case studies lay out perfect examples that other communities can easily follow. Among the case study sites are Sanibel Island, Florida; Austin, Texas; Baltimore County, Maryland; Charlotte Harbor, Florida; and Teton County, Wyoming. Nature-Friendly Communities offers a useful overview of the increasing number of communities that have established successful nature protection programs and the significant benefits those programs provide.

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading pro-slavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America. Contrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited.

The term gentrification has become a buzzword to describe the changes in urban neighborhoods across the country, but we don't realize just how threatening it is. It means more than the arrival of trendy shops, much-maligned hipsters, and expensive lattes. The very future of American cities as vibrant, equitable spaces hangs in the balance. Peter Moskowitz's How to Kill a City takes readers from the kitchen tables of hurting families who can no longer afford their homes to the corporate boardrooms and political backrooms where destructive housing policies are devised. Along the way, Moskowitz uncovers the massive, systemic forces behind gentrification in New Orleans, Detroit, San Francisco, and New York. The deceptively simple question of who can and cannot afford to pay the rent goes to the heart of America's crises of race and inequality.

Whence it follows that a war of extermination, where the process of annihilation would strike both parties at once and all right as well, would bring out perpetual peace only in the great graveyard of the human race.-from \"Perpetual Peace\"One of the most influential thinkers of the Western civilization, a man who profoundly shaped the mind-set of the modern world, examines war and human nature and concludes, bracingly, that global peace is inevitable. Far from an unattainable utopian fantasy, this 1795 essay lays out the requirements for peace, including republican governments, freedom of movement for citizens, and-prophetically-the formation of a league of nations. In this era of imperialistic ambitions and preemptive wars, Kant's insight is a profound reminder that peace is possible but must be actively pursued.Also available from Cosimo Classics: Kant's Analytic of the Beautiful and Perpetual Peace.German metaphysician IMMANUEL KANT (1724-1804) served as a librarian of the Royal Library, a prestigious government position, and as a professor at K nigsberg University.

But too often, he notes, urban greening efforts focus on everything except nature, emphasizing such elements as public transit, renewable energy production, and energy efficient building systems. While these are important aspects of reimagining urban living, they are not enough, says Beatley. We must remember that human beings have an innate need to connect with the natural world (the biophilia hypothesis). And any vision of a sustainable urban future must place its focus squarely on nature, on the presence, conservation, and celebration of the actual green features and natural life forms. A biophilic city is more than simply a biodiverse city, says Beatley. It is a place that learns from nature and emulates natural systems, incorporates natural forms and images into its buildings and cityscapes, and designs and plans in conjunction with nature. A biophilic city cherishes the natural features that already exist but also works to restore and repair what has been lost or degraded. In Biophilic Cities Beatley not only outlines the essential elements of a biophilic city, but provides examples and stories about cities that have successfully integrated biophilic elements--from the building to the regional level--around the world. From urban ecological networks and connected systems of urban greenspace, to green rooftops and green walls and sidewalk gardens, Beatley reviews the emerging practice of biophilic urban design and planning, and tells many compelling stories of individuals and groups working hard to transform cities from grey and lifeless to green and biodiverse.", "page_count": 191, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLAN3860-1", "PLAN6860-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-59853-053-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781598530537", "isbn10": "1598530534", "title": "Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches And Writings: A Library Of America Paperback Classic", "author": "['Abraham Lincoln']", "req_type": "Recommended", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/37/9781598530537.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.95, "bookstore_used_price": 8.43, "publisher": "Library Of America", "date": "2009", "description": "Records Lincoln's campaigns for public office, the evolution of his stand against slavery, his debates with Stephen Douglas, and the great addresses of his presidency.", "page_count": 550, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["PLAP4500-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-59853-094-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781598530940", "isbn10": "1598530941", "title": "American Speeches: Political Oratory from Patrick Henry to Barack Obama", "author": "WIDMER", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gmCmSgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gmCmSgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 12.95, "bookstore_used_price": 6.45, "publisher": "Library of America", "date": "2011", "description": "Collects the unabridged texts of forty-seven important speeches, including Patrick Henry's \"liberty or death\" speech, Sojourner Truth's declamation to the 1851 Women's Rights Convention, and Barack Obama's speech on race from the 2008 presidential campaign.", "page_count": 403, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ENWR2800-3", "HIUS2002-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-59853-151-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781598531510", "isbn10": "1598531514", "title": "Democracy in America", "author": "['Alexis de Tocqueville', 'Olivier Zunz', 'Arthur Goldhammer']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mxmSZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mxmSZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 14.95, "bookstore_used_price": 7.43, "publisher": "", "date": "2012", "description": "An influential study of America's national government, egalitarian ideals, and character offers reflections on the effect of majority rule on the rights of individuals and provides insight into the rewards and responsibilities of a democratic government.", "page_count": 571, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS4501-3"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-59853-152-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781598531527", "isbn10": "1598531522", "title": "Democracy in America: The Arthur Goldhammer Translation", "author": "['Alexis de Tocqueville', 'Olivier Zunz', 'Arthur Goldhammer']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=toefZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=toefZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 14.95, "bookstore_used_price": 7.45, "publisher": "", "date": "2012", "description": "A French aristocrat's account of the ways in which democratic ideals were applied in America during the nineteenth century.", "page_count": 414, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS4501-3"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-60406-395-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781604063950", "isbn10": "1604063955", "title": "Medical Speech-language Pathology: A Practitioner's Guide", "author": "['Johnson', 'Alex F.

Topics range from the \u201calien\u201d experience of blacks in America to the \u201cwake up\u201d cry peppering sci-fi literature, sermons, and activism. Interviews with rappers, composers, musicians, singers, authors, comic illustrators, painters, and DJs, as well as Afrofuturist professors, will provide a firsthand look at this fascinating movement.

As he grew older, he realized he had addiction in his family. Confused, unable to know what to do, he set out on a three-year, 30,000-mile journey to discover what really causes addiction--and what really solves it. He uncovered a range of remarkable human stories--of how the war on drugs began with Billie Holiday, the great jazz singer, being stalked and killed by a racist policeman; of the scientist who discovered the surprising key to addiction; and of the countries that ended their war on drugs--with extraordinary results. His discoveries led him to give a TED talk and animation which have now been viewed more than 25 million times.

It's romantic and exciting to think of leadership as all inspiration, decisive action, and rich rewards, but leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disrupting the status quo, and surfacing hidden conflict. And when people resist and push back, there's a strong temptation to play it safe. Those who choose to lead plunge in, take the risks, and sometimes get burned. But it doesn't have to be that way say renowned leadership experts Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky. In Leadership on the Line, they show how it's possible to make a difference without getting \"taken out\" or pushed aside. They present everyday tools that give equal weight to the dangerous work of leading change and the critical importance of personal survival. Through vivid stories from all walks of life, the authors present straightforward strategies for navigating the perilous straits of leadership.

Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing it, revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades--the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400.

Even today Hannibal's brilliant, if ultimately unsuccessful, campaign against Rome during the Second Punic War (218-202 BC) make him one of history's most celebrated military leaders. This biography by Cornelius Nepos (c. 100-27 BC) sketches Hannibal's life from the time he began traveling with his father's army as a young boy, through his sixteen-year invasion of Italy and his tumultuous political career in Carthage, to his perilous exile and eventual suicide in the East. As Rome completed its bloody transition from dysfunctional republic to stable monarchy, Nepos labored to complete an innovative and influential collection of concise biographies. Putting aside the detailed, chronological accounts of military campaigns and political machinations that characterized most writing about history, Nepos surveyed Roman and Greek history for distinguished men who excelled in a range of prestigious occupations. In the exploits and achievements of these illustrious men, Nepos hoped that his readers would find models for the honorable conduct of their own lives. Although most of Nepos' works have been lost, we are fortunate to have his biography of Hannibal. Nepos offers a surprisingly balanced portrayal of a man that most Roman authors vilified as the most monstrous foe that Rome had ever faced. Nepos' straightforward style and his preference for common vocabulary make Life of Hannibal accessible for those who are just beginning to read continuous Latin prose, while the historical interest of the subject make it compelling for readers of every ability.", "page_count": 174, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["LATI2010-ALL"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-84022-403-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781840224030", "isbn10": "1840224037", "title": "The Last Man", "author": "['Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HOg-sWtYVwAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HOg-sWtYVwAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 5.99, "bookstore_used_price": 3.73, "publisher": "Wordsworth Editions", "date": "2004", "description": "Presents an apocalyptic fantasy of the end of human civilisation.

Most remarkably, as the author discovered, the qualities each country ascribed to its chief adversary appeared to be exaggerated or negative versions of precisely those qualities that it perceived to be lacking or inadequate in itself. Moreover, banishing undesirable traits and projecting them onto another people was also an essential step in the consolidation of national identity. As such, it established a pattern that has become all too familiar to students of nationalism and xenophobia in recent decades.

A nanny lets go of a little girl's hand in Shiraz's exotic and crowded Vakil Bazaar, and goes off to flirt with the nutseller -- the child is lost. In The Accident, the author portrays, in hilarious parody, a young woman who forsakes husband, children, and home just to own a car. The Playhouse is a traditional Persian theatre where the play and the players act on many levels both real and fantastic. The Traitor's Intrigue lets you into the life of a middle-class couple and brilliantly shows how a colonel's allegiance passed from Shah to Khomeini. To Whom Can I Say Hello? tells of an old woman's memories, her life, love, tragic outcome, and eventual hope. Loss of Jalal is a moving chronicle of the final days of Jalal Al-e Ahmad, one of Iran's great writers and the author's husband. Simin Daneshvar draws from over a thousand years of Persian storytelling tradition and combines this with modern techniques of short fiction and cinema. The result is both entertaining and a key of uncompromising honesty, rich detail, and a dazzling range of voices that guides the reader into the centre of a complex society and its concerns.", "page_count": 183, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PETR3559-2", "PETR5559-3"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "1-933880-00-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781933880006", "isbn10": "1933880007", "title": "Against which", "author": "['Ross Gay']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tl6xAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tl6xAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.0, "bookstore_used_price": 11.94, "publisher": "Cavankerry PressLtd", "date": "2006", "description": "An exploration of the various ways language can help us transcend both the banal and unusual cruelties which are inevitably delivered to us, and which we equally deliver unto others.

Mayer was the highest-paid man in the country, and Hollywood produced 530 feature films a year. One decade and five thousand movies later, the studios were faltering. The 1940s became the decade of Hollywood's decline: anticommunist hysteria excommunicated some of its best talent, while a 1948 antitrust consent decree ended many of the business practices that had made the studio system so profitable. In this masterful work of cultural history, the legendary Otto Friedrich tells the story of Hollywood's heyday and decline in a vivid narrative featuring an all-star cast of the actors, writers, musicians, composers, producers, directors, racketeers, labor leaders, journalists, and politicians who played major parts in the movie capital during the turbulent decade from World War II to the Korean War. Friedrich draws on sources from celebrity biographies to trade-union history, mingling lively gossip with analysis of Hollywood's seedier business dealings and telling the stories of legendary movies such as Citizen Kane, The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, and All About Eve.

Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style\u2014thorough, yet riveting\u2014famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century\u2014from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.

However, the relatively recent advent of fast and inexpensive computational power has opened up another approach--namely, to try to model the phenomenon as faithfully as possible and then to rely on a simulation study to analyze it\"--", "page_count": 310, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["SYS3062-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-12-801148-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780128011485", "isbn10": "0128011483", "title": "Exercise-Cognition Interaction: Neuroscience Perspectives", "author": "['Terry McMorris']", "req_type": "Optional", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G_BeBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G_BeBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 52.5, "bookstore_used_price": 0.0, "publisher": "Academic Press", "date": "2015-11-06", "description": "Exercise-Cognition Interaction: Neuroscience Perspectives is the only book on the market that examines the neuroscientific correlation between exercise and cognitive functioning.

It is well documented that our healthcare system has grave problems, but how, in only a matter of decades, did things get this bad? Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal doesn't just explain the symptoms; she diagnoses and treats the disease itself. Rosenthal spells out in clear and practical terms exactly how to decode medical doublespeak, avoid the pitfalls of the pharmaceuticals racket, and get the care you and your family deserve. She takes you inside the doctor-patient relationship, explaining step by step the workings of a profession sorely lacking transparency. This is about what we can do, as individual patients, both to navigate a byzantine system and also to demand far-reaching reform. Breaking down the monolithic business into its individual industries--the hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, drug manufacturers--that together constitute our healthcare system, Rosenthal tells the story of the history of American medicine as never before. The situation is far worse than we think, and it has become like that much more recently than we realize. Hospitals, which are managed by business executives, behave like predatory lenders, hounding patients and seizing their homes. Research charities are in bed with big pharmaceutical companies, which surreptitiously profit from the donations made by working people. Americans are dying from routine medical conditions when affordable and straightforward solutions exist. Dr. Rosenthal explains for the first time how various social and financial incentives have encouraged a disastrous and immoral system to spring uporganicallyin a shockingly short span of time. The system is in tatters, but we can fight back. An American Sicknessis the frontline defense against a healthcare system that no longer has our well-being at heart\"--", "page_count": 432, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 7, "class_objects": ["SOC2559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-14-311235-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780143112358", "isbn10": "014311235X", "title": "a-man-on-the-moon", "author": "['Andrew L.

The astronauts themselves have called it the definitive account of their missions. On the night of July 20, 1969, our world changed forever when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon. Based on in-depth interviews with twenty-three of the twenty-four moon voyagers, as well as those who struggled to get the program moving, <i>A Man on the Moon</i> conveys every aspect of the Apollo missions with breathtaking immediacy and stunning detail. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Scheduled to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the first lunar landing on July 20, 1969, this chronicle offers a comprehensive, often penetrating look at NASA's Apollo program. Originating in 1961, when President John Kennedy told Congress that the U.S. should attempt to land a man on the moon ``before this decade is out,'' the program's last mission ended in December, 1972, with the splashdown of Apollo 17. Diary-like reports mix with first- and third-person accounts as Chaikin, an editor at Sky And Telescope magazine, delivers a chronological view of the missions and those who planned and flew them. Focusing closely on the Apollo astronauts, including Buzz Aldrin, Pete Conrad and Neil Armstrong, Chaikin gives his topic a sense of immediacy. But his treatment, lengthy as it is, reads more like an extended magazine article. Missing is a view of Apollo in a wider context, one that captures the mythos of our efforts to land on the moon.

Rather they are crafted by individuals, firms, and most of all, by governments. Like statecraft, \"marketcraft\" represents a core function of government, and it requires considerable artistry to govern markets effectively. In Marketcraft, Steven K. Vogel builds his argument upon the recognition that all markets are crafted and then systematically explores the implications for analysis and policy. Vogel marshals a wide range of policy examples to support this concept, focusing in particular on the U.S. and Japan. He examines how the U.S., the \"freest\" market economy, is actually among the most heavily regulated advanced economies, while Japan's effort to liberalize its economy in the 1990s counterintuitively expanded the government's role in practice.

By the mid-2000s, GM soybeans were cultivated on more than half of the arable land in Argentina and represented one-fourth of the country's exports. While this agricultural boom has benefitted agribusiness companies and fed tax revenues, it also has a dark side: it has accelerated the deforestation of native forests, prompted the eviction of indigenous and peasant families, and spurred episodes of contamination. In Soybeans and Power, Pablo Lapegna investigates the ways in which rural populations have coped with GM soybean expansion in Argentina. Based on over a decade of ethnographic research, Lapegna reveals that many communities initially resisted, yet ultimately adapted to the new agricultural technologies forced upon them by public officials. However, rather than painting the decline of the protests in an exclusively negative light, Lapegna argues that the farmers played an active role in their own demobilization, switching to tactics of negotiation and accommodation in order to maneuver the situation to their advantage. Lapegna offers a rare, on the ground glimpse into the life cycle of a social movement, from mobilization and protest to demobilization and resigned acceptance. Through the case study of Argentina, a major player in the use and export of GM crops, Soybeans and Power gives voice to the communities most adversely affected by GM technology, as well as the strategies that they have enacted in order to survive.", "page_count": 248, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["SOC3820-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-021609-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780190216092", "isbn10": "0190216093", "title": "International Politics: How History Modifies Theory", "author": "['John M.

The range of Freedman's narrative is extraordinary, moving from the surprisingly advanced strategy practiced in primate groups, to the opposing strategies of Achilles and Odysseus in The Iliad, the strategic advice of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli, the great military innovations of Baron Henri de Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz, the grounding of revolutionary strategy in class struggles by Marx, the insights into corporate strategy found in Peter Drucker and Alfred Sloan, and the contributions of the leading social scientists working on strategy today. The core issue at the heart of strategy, the author notes, is whether it is possible to manipulate and shape our environment rather than simply become the victim of forces beyond one's control. Time and again, Freedman demonstrates that the inherent unpredictability of this environment-subject to chance events, the efforts of opponents, the missteps of friends-provides strategy with its challenge and its drama. Armies or corporations or nations rarely move from one predictable state of affairs to another, but instead feel their way through a series of states, each one not quite what was anticipated, requiring a reappraisal of the original strategy, including its ultimate objective. Thus the picture of strategy that emerges in this book is one that is fluid and flexible, governed by the starting point, not the end point.

As one of the longest reigning monarchs in British history, Queen Victoria gave her name to an age filled with enormous possibilities and perplexing contradictions. At the time of Victoria's birth, Britain ruled over what was fast becoming the greatest empire in the world, containing millions of non-white, non-Christian peoples. During her childhood and youth, the kingdom itself became transformed from one dominated by landed aristocrats to one governed according to the principles of bourgeois liberalism. The royal family served as the most visible symbol of domesticity, while at the same time Victoria's very position as queen defied the ideology of separate spheres upon which domesticity rested. Victoria, the ruler of millions of people, opposed women participating in politics or public life. She believed women's suffrage to be a \"wicked folly\" and a violation of God's laws. She never gave up that belief, even as the fledging feminist movement of mid-century matured and grew to the size of a mass movement by the end of the century. And yet she reigned, with little thought of the contradictions that entailed. We live in a global age where big concepts like \"globalization\" often tempt us to forget the personal side of the past. The titles in The World in A Life series aim to revive these meaningful lives. Each one shows us what it was like to live on a world historical stage. Brief, inexpensive, and thematic, each book can be read in a week, fit within a wide range of curricula, and shed insight into a particular place or time.

Serving an enviably affluent, diverse, and liberal district, the school is well-funded, its teachers are well-trained, and many of its students are high achieving. Yet Riverview has not escaped the same unrelenting question that plagues schools throughout America: why is it that even when all of the circumstances seem right, black and Latino students continue to lag behind their peers? Through five years' worth of interviews and data-gathering at Riverview, John Diamond and Amanda Lewis have created a rich and disturbing portrait of the achievement gap that persists more than fifty years after the formal dismantling of segregation. As students progress from elementary school to middle school to high school, their level of academic achievement increasingly tracks along racial lines, with white and Asian students maintaining higher GPAs and standardized testing scores, taking more advanced classes, and attaining better college admission results than their black and Latino counterparts. Most research to date has focused on the role of poverty, family stability, and other external influences in explaining poor performance at school, especially in urban contexts. Diamond and Lewis instead situate their research in a suburban school, and look at what factors within the school itself could be causing the disparity. Most crucially, they challenge many common explanations of the 'racial achievement gap,' exploring what race actually means in this situation, and why it matters. An in-depth study with far-reaching consequences, Despite the Best Intentions revolutionizes our understanding of both the knotty problem of academic disparities and the larger question of the color line in American society.", "page_count": 272, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF3460-1", "EDLF5700-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-068309-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780190683092", "isbn10": "0190683090", "title": "The Caucasus: An Introduction", "author": "['Thomas De Waal']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bS3sswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bS3sswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 18.95, "bookstore_used_price": 14.2, "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "date": "2018-11-13", "description": "Machine generated contents note: -- Dedicaton -- Author's Note -- Introduction -- 1.

Ten years later, an oracle makes it clear that the war cannot be won without the assistance of Philoctetes and his famous bow, inherited from Hercules himself. Philoctetes focuses on the attempt of Neoptolemus and the hero Odysseus to persuade the bowman to sail with them to Troy. First, though, they must assuage his bitterness over having been abandoned, and then win his trust. But how should they do this--through trickery, or with the truth?

The First World War produced an extraordinary flowering of poetic talent, from poets whose words commemorate the conflict as enduringly as monuments in stone. Their poems have come to express the feelings of a nation about the horrors and aftermath of war. This new anthology provides a definitive record of the achievements of the Great War poets. As well as offering generous selections from the celebrated soldier-poets, including Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Rupert Brooke, and Ivor Gurney, it also incorporates less well-known writing by civilian and women poets. Music hall and trench songs provide a further lyrical perspective on the War. The work of each poet is prefaced with a biographical account that sets the poems in their historical context. In addition, Tim Kendall's introduction charts the history of the war poets' reception, and challenges prevailing myths about their progress from idealism to bitterness.

Students are faced with a disconnect between the algorithmic and informal attitude to mathematics at school, versus a new emphasis on proof, based on logic, and a more abstract development of general concepts, based on set theory. The authors have many years' experience of the potential difficulties involved, through teaching first-year undergraduates and researching the ways in which students and mathematicians think. The book explains the motivation behind abstract foundational material based on students' experiences of school mathematics, and explicitly suggests ways students can make sense of formal ideas. This second edition takes a significant step forward by not only making the transition from intuitive to formal methods, but also by reversing the process- using structure theorems to prove that formal systems have visual and symbolic interpretations that enhance mathematical thinking. This is exemplified by a new chapter on the theory of groups. While the first edition extended counting to infinite cardinal numbers, the second also extends the real numbers rigorously to larger ordered fields. This links intuitive ideas in calculus to the formal epsilon-delta methods of analysis. The approach here is not the conventional one of 'nonstandard analysis', but a simpler, graphically based treatment which makes the notion of an infinitesimal natural and straightforward. This allows a further vision of the wider world of mathematical thinking in which formal definitions and proof lead to amazing new ways of defining, proving, visualising and symbolising mathematics beyond previous expectations.", "page_count": 432, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["MATH3000-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-870988-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780198709886", "isbn10": "0198709889", "title": "Principles of Development", "author": "['Lewis Wolpert', 'Cheryll Tickle', 'Alfonso Martinez Arias']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbO6BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbO6BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 145.84, "bookstore_used_price": 91.43, "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "date": "2015", "description": "The process of biological development is an amazing feat of tightly regulated cellular behaviours--differentiation, movement, and growth--powerful enough to result in the emergence of a highly complex living organism from a single cell: the fertilized egg.

But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence. This profoundly ambitious and original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.", "page_count": 384, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["GBUS8638-ALL", "PAVS4500-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-874029-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780198740292", "isbn10": "0198740298", "title": "Witchcraft, Oracles And Magic Among The Azande", "author": "['E.

At the age of eighteen, sick of her narrow existence, she seeks work as a governess. The monotony of Jane's new life at Thornfield Hall is broken up by the arrival of her peculiar and changeful employer, Mr Rochester. Routine at the mansion is further disrupted by mysterious incidents that draw the pair closer together but which, once explained, threaten Jane's happiness and integrity. A flagship of Victorian fiction, Jane Eyre draws the reader in by the vigour of Jane's voice and the novel's forceful depiction of childhood injustice, of the restraints placed upon women, and the complexities of both faith and passion. The emotional charge of Jane's story is as strong today as it was more than 150 years ago, as she seeks dignity and freedom on her own terms.

Typically they reacted to it with fear and distrust; and such feelings were reinforced by the deep hostility of Western Christendom towards Islam. Yet there was also much curiosity about the social and political system on which the huge power of the sultans was based. In the sixteenth century, especially, when Ottoman territorial expansion was rapid and Ottoman institutions seemed particularly robust, there was even open admiration. In this path-breaking book Noel Malcolm ranges through these vital centuries of East-West interaction, studying all the ways in which thinkers in the West interpreted the Ottoman Empire as a political phenomenon - and Islam as a political religion. Useful Enemies shows how the concept of 'oriental despotism' began as an attempt to turn the tables on a very positive analysis of Ottoman state power, and how, as it developed, it interacted with Western debates about monarchy and government. Noel Malcolm also shows how a negative portrayal of Islam as a religion devised for political purposes was assimilated by radical writers, who extended the criticism to all religions, including Christianity itself. Examining the works of many famous thinkers (including Machiavelli, Bodin, and Montesquieu) and many less well-known ones, Useful Enemies illuminates the long-term development of Western ideas about the Ottomans, and about Islam. Noel Malcolm shows how these ideas became intertwined with internal Western debates about power, religion, society, and war. Discussions of Islam and the Ottoman Empire were thus bound up with mainstream thinking in the West on a wide range of important topics. These Eastern enemies were not just there to be denounced. They were there to be made use of, in arguments which contributed significantly to the development of Western political thought.", "page_count": 512, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLPT8500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-922681-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780199226818", "isbn10": "0199226814", "title": "Psychoanalysis: A Very Short Introduction", "author": "['Daniel Pick']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fg9PCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fg9PCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 8.21, "bookstore_used_price": 6.5, "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "date": "2015", "description": "Since its inception, psychoanalysis has been hailed as a revolutionary theory of how the mind works, and some of its ideas have inspired art, literature, and film, and become part of everyday conversation.

Early modern yoga also encompassed countercultural beliefs and practices. In contrast, today, modern yoga aims at the enhancement of the mind-body complex but does so according to contemporary dominant metaphysical, health, and fitness paradigms. Consequently, yoga is now a part of popular culture. In Selling Yoga, Andrea R. Jain explores the popularization of yoga in the context of late-twentieth-century consumer culture. She departs from conventional approaches by undermining essentialist definitions of yoga as well as assumptions that yoga underwent a linear trajectory of increasing popularization. While some studies trivialize popularized yoga systems by reducing them to the mere commodification or corruption of what is perceived as an otherwise fixed, authentic system, Jain suggests that this dichotomy oversimplifies the history of yoga as well as its meanings for contemporary practitioners. By discussing a wide array of modern yoga types, from Iyengar Yoga to Bikram Yoga, Jain argues that popularized yoga cannot be dismissed--that it has a variety of religious meanings and functions. Yoga brands destabilize the basic utility of yoga commodities and assign to them new meanings that represent the fulfillment of self-developmental needs often deemed sacred in contemporary consumer culture.", "page_count": 240, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELH5173-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-953755-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780199537556", "isbn10": "0199537550", "title": "Castle Rackrent (oxford World's Classics)", "author": "['Maria Edgeworth']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/56/9780199537556.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 13.95, "bookstore_used_price": 6.94, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "date": "2009", "description": "Maria Edgworth ; Edited By George Watson.

The sequence of dazzling speeches culminates in Socrates' famous account of the views of Diotima, a prophetess who taught him that love is our means of trying to attain goodness. And then into the party bursts the drunken Alcibiades, the most popular and notorious Athenian of the time, who insists on praising Socrates himself rather than love, and gives us a brilliant sketch of this enigmatic character.

M. W. Dixon provides a new and fundamental characterization of the nature of human languages and a comprehensive guide to their description and analysis. In three clearly written and accessible volumes, he describes how best to go about doing linguistics, the most satisfactory and profitable ways to work, and the pitfalls to avoid. In the first volume he addresses the methodology for recording, analysing, and comparing languages. He argues that grammatical structures and rules should be worked out inductively on the basis of evidence, explaining in detail the steps by which an attested grammar and lexicon can built up from observed utterances. He shows how the grammars and words of one language may be compared to others of the same or different families, explains the methods involved in cross-linguistic parametric analyses, and describes how to interpret the results. Volume 2 and volume 3 (to be published in 2011) offer in-depth tours of underlying principles of grammatical organization, as well as many of the facts of grammatical variation. 'The task of the linguist,' Professor Dixon writes, 'is to explain the nature of human languages - each viewed as an integrated system - together with an explanation of why each language is the way it is, allied to the further scientific pursuits of prediction and evaluation.' <b>Basic Linguistic Theory</b> is the triumphant outcome of a lifetime's thinking about every aspect and manifestation of language and immersion in linguistic fieldwork. It is a one-stop text for undergraduate and graduate students of linguistics, as well as for those in neighbouring disciplines, such as psychology and anthropology.", "page_count": 0, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ANTH5401-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-957283-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780199572830", "isbn10": "0199572836", "title": "A Journal of the Plague Year", "author": "['Daniel Defoe']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cXN_7uUTDOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cXN_7uUTDOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 9.95, "bookstore_used_price": 4.94, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "date": "2010-09-09", "description": "\"This edition includes: Introduction -- Textual note -- Bibliography -- Chronology -- Medical note -- Explanatory notes -- Topographical index -- Map.

More important, he recaptures the drama of slaves, freed blacks, and white reformers fighting to make the young nation fulfill its republican slogans. Although this struggle often unfolded in the corridors of power, Egerton pays special attention to what black Americans did for themselves in these decades, and his narrative brims with compelling portraits of forgotten African American activists and rebels, who battled huge odds and succeeded in finding liberty--if never equality--only in northern states.

African Religions: A Very Short Introduction answers this question by examining primarily indigenous religious traditions on the African continent. It focuses on the diversity of people, ethnic groups, languages, cultures, ethos, and worldviews, keeping in mind the continent's regional diversity. Using a multidisciplinary methodological approach, Olupona examines a wide range of African religious traditions on their own terms as well as in their pluralistic social, cultural, and political contexts. Cultural and postcolonial interpretive frameworks benefit the discussion. For example, the book moves beyond ethnographic descriptions and interpretations of core beliefs and practices to look at how African religion has engaged issues of socioeconomic development and power relations. Sources for this book include archaeological and historical references. Additionally, Olupona uses ethnographic materials based on fieldwork collected through interviewsand participant observation, along with archival materials, including missionary records, which describe African religious practices. Though the emphasis is on native faith traditions, these are not static traditions. African religions have responded to changes within their local communities and to fluxes caused by outside influences. About the Series: Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects - from Islam to Sociology,Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative - yet always balanced and complete - discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.", "page_count": 152, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELA2750-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-19-984080-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780199840809", "isbn10": "0199840806", "title": "Europe in the Modern World: A New Narrative History, Since 1500", "author": "['Edward Berenson']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dnq8jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dnq8jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 59.95, "bookstore_used_price": 44.75, "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "date": "2016-09-30", "description": "Europe in the Modern World: A New Narrative History Since 1500 is an unusually engaging narrative history of Europe since 1500.

Many believe that this shift began with the \"tough on crime\" policies advocated by Republicans and southern Democrats beginning in the late 1960s, which sought longer prison sentences, more frequent use of the death penalty, and the explicit or implicit targeting of politically marginalized people. In The First Civil Right, Naomi Murakawa inverts the conventional wisdom by arguing that the expansion of the federal carceral state-a system that disproportionately imprisons blacks and Latinos-was, in fact, rooted in the civil-rights liberalism of the 1940s and early 1960s, not in the period after. Murakawa traces the development of the modern American prison system through several presidencies, both Republican and Democrat. Responding to calls to end the lawlessness and violence against blacks at the state and local levels, the Truman administration expanded the scope of what was previously a weak federal system. Later administrations from Johnson to Clinton expanded the federal presence even more. Ironically, these steps laid the groundwork for the creation of the vast penal archipelago that now exists in the United States. What began as a liberal initiative to curb the mob violence and police brutality that had deprived racial minorities of their first civil right - physical safety - eventually evolved into the federal correctional system that now deprives them, in unjustly large numbers, of another important right: freedom.

Emerson, Rachel I. Fretz, and Linda L.

Using actual unfinished notes as examples, the authors illustrate options for composing, reviewing, and working fieldnotes into finished texts. They discuss different organizational and descriptive strategies and show how transforming direct observations into vivid descriptions results not simply from good memory but from learning to envision scenes as written. A good ethnographer, they demonstrate, must learn to remember dialogue and movement like an actor, to see colors and shapes like a painter, and to sense moods and rhythms like a poet. This new edition reflects the extensive feedback the authors have received from students and instructors since the first edition was published in 1995. As a result, they have updated the race, class, and gender section, created new sections on coding programs and revising first drafts, and provided new examples of working notes.

So it is ironic that most scholars who do research on the intimate experiences of ordinary people write their books in a style that those people cannot understand. In recent years, the ethnographic method has spread from its original home in cultural anthropology to fields such as sociology, marketing, media studies, law, criminology, education, cultural studies, history, geography, and political science. Yet, while more and more students and practitioners are learning how to write ethnographies, there is little or no training on how to write ethnographies well. From Notes to Narrative picks up where methodological training leaves off. Kristen Ghodsee, an award-winning ethnographer, addresses common issues that arise in ethnographic writing. Ghodsee works through sentence-level details, such as word choice and structure. She also tackles bigger-picture elements, such as how to incorporate theory and ethnographic details, how to effectively deploy dialogue, and how to avoid distracting elements such as long block quotations and in-text citations. She includes excerpts and examples from model ethnographies. The book concludes with a bibliography of other useful writing guides and nearly one hundred examples of eminently readable ethnographic books.", "page_count": 158, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ANTH7040-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-226-31144-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780226311449", "isbn10": "0226311449", "title": "Aeschylus I: The Persians, The Seven Against Thebes, The Suppliant Maidens, Prometheus Bound", "author": "['Aeschylus']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fV-iMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fV-iMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 13.0, "bookstore_used_price": 9.7, "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "date": "2013-04-19", "description": "Aeschylus I contains \u201cThe Persians,\u201d translated by Seth Benardete; \u201cThe Seven Against Thebes,\u201d translated by David Grene; \u201cThe Suppliant Maidens,\u201d translated by Seth Benardete; and \u201cPrometheus Bound,\u201d translated by David Grene. Sixty years ago, the University of Chicago Press undertook a momentous project: a new translation of the Greek tragedies that would be the ultimate resource for teachers, students, and readers. They succeeded. Under the expert management of eminent classicists David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, those translations combined accuracy, poetic immediacy, and clarity of presentation to render the surviving masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in an English so lively and compelling that they remain the standard translations. Today, Chicago is taking pains to ensure that our Greek tragedies remain the leading English-language versions throughout the twenty-first century. In this highly anticipated third edition, Mark Griffith and Glenn W. Most have carefully updated the translations to bring them even closer to the ancient Greek while retaining the vibrancy for which our English versions are famous. This edition also includes brand-new translations of Euripides\u2019 Medea, The Children of Heracles, Andromache, and Iphigenia among the Taurians, fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus, and the surviving portion of Sophocles\u2019s satyr-drama The Trackers.

In addition, each volume includes an introduction to the life and work of its tragedian, as well as notes addressing textual uncertainties and a glossary of names and places mentioned in the plays. In addition to the new content, the volumes have been reorganized both within and between volumes to reflect the most up-to-date scholarship on the order in which the plays were originally written.

Originally published in 1944\u2014when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program\u2014The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, The Road to Serfdom garnered immediate, widespread attention. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 books were sold. In April 1945, Reader\u2019s Digest published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this edition to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best seller, the book has sold 400,000 copies in the United States alone and has been translated into more than twenty languages, along the way becoming one of the most important and influential books of the century. With this new edition, The Road to Serfdom takes its place in the series The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek. The volume includes a foreword by series editor and leading Hayek scholar Bruce Caldwell explaining the book's origins and publishing history and assessing common misinterpretations of Hayek's thought. Caldwell has also standardized and corrected Hayek's references and added helpful new explanatory notes.

Regrettably, the reality hasn\u2019t lived up to that expectation. Instead, Americans\u2019 political beliefs have become significantly more polarized by racial considerations than they had been before Obama\u2019s presidency\u2014in spite of his administration\u2019s considerable efforts to neutralize the political impact of race. Michael Tesler shows how, in the years that followed the 2008 election\u2014a presidential election more polarized by racial attitudes than any other in modern times\u2014racial considerations have come increasingly to influence many aspects of political decision making. These range from people\u2019s evaluations of prominent politicians and the parties to issues seemingly unrelated to race like assessments of public policy or objective economic conditions. Some people even displayed more positive feelings toward Obama\u2019s dog, Bo, when they were told he belonged to Ted Kennedy. More broadly, Tesler argues that the rapidly intensifying influence of race in American politics is driving the polarizing partisan divide and the vitriolic atmosphere that has come to characterize American politics.

In the most alarmist views, the West\u2019s most cherished values\u2014freedom, equality, and tolerance\u2014are said to be endangered by Islam worldwide. Joseph Massad\u2019s Islam in Liberalism explores what Islam has become in today\u2019s world, with full attention to the multiplication of its meanings and interpretations. He seeks to understand how anxieties about tyranny, intolerance, misogyny, and homophobia, seen in the politics of the Middle East, are projected onto Islam itself. Massad shows that through this projection Europe emerges as democratic and tolerant, feminist, and pro-LGBT rights\u2014or, in short, Islam-free. Massad documents the Christian and liberal idea that we should missionize democracy, women\u2019s rights, sexual rights, tolerance, equality, and even therapies to cure Muslims of their un-European, un-Christian, and illiberal ways. Along the way he sheds light on a variety of controversial topics, including the meanings of democracy\u2014and the ideological assumption that Islam is not compatible with it while Christianity is\u2014women in Islam, sexuality and sexual freedom, and the idea of Abrahamic religions valorizing an interfaith agenda.

The campaign and election of Donald Trump laid bare this fact of the American electorate, its successful rhetoric of \u201cus versus them\u201d tapping into a powerful current of anger and resentment.

Even when Democrats and Republicans can agree on policy outcomes, they tend to view one other with distrust and to work for party victory over all else. Although the polarizing effects of social divisions have simplified our electoral choices and increased political engagement, they have not been a force that is, on balance, helpful for American democracy.

The only woman, and the only person without a weapon, she walked alongside the militants for seven nights across 150 miles of dense, hilly forests in eastern India. Nightmarch is the riveting story of Shah's journey, grounded in her years of living with India\u2019s tribal people, an eye-opening exploration of the movement\u2019s history and future and a powerful contemplation of how disadvantaged people fight back against unjust systems in today\u2019s world. The Naxalites have fought for a communist society for the past fifty years, caught in a conflict that has so far claimed at least forty thousand lives. Yet surprisingly little is known about these fighters in the West. Framed by the Indian state as a deadly terrorist group, the movement is actually made up of Marxist ideologues and lower-caste and tribal combatants, all of whom seek to overthrow a system that has abused them for decades. In Nightmarch, Shah shares some of their gritty untold stories: here we meet a high-caste leader who spent almost thirty years underground, a young Adivasi foot soldier, and an Adivasi youth who defected. Speaking with them and living for years with villagers in guerrilla strongholds, Shah has sought to understand why some of India\u2019s poor have shunned the world\u2019s largest democracy and taken up arms to fight for a fairer society\u2014and asks whether they might be undermining their own aims. By shining a light on this largely ignored corner of the world, Shah raises important questions about the uncaring advance of capitalism and offers a compelling reflection on dispossession and conflict at the heart of contemporary India.", "page_count": 320, "google_rating": 1.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["HISA3003-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-226-63809-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780226638096", "isbn10": "022663809X", "title": "Mobilizing Mutations: Human Genetics in the Age of Patient Advocacy", "author": "['Daniel Navon']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LfuwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LfuwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 40.0, "bookstore_used_price": 30.0, "publisher": "", "date": "2019", "description": "With every passing year, more and more people learn that they or their young or unborn children carries a genetic mutation.

But when detailing the many things that the poor have not, we often overlook the most critical\u2014their health. The poor die sooner. Blacks die sooner. And poor urban blacks die sooner than almost all other Americans. In nearly four decades as a doctor at hospitals serving some of the poorest communities in Chicago, David A. Ansell, MD, has witnessed firsthand the lives behind these devastating statistics. In The Death Gap, he gives a grim survey of these realities, drawn from observations and stories of his patients. While the contrasts and disparities among Chicago\u2019s communities are particularly stark, the death gap is truly a nationwide epidemic\u2014as Ansell shows, there is a thirty-five-year difference in life expectancy between the healthiest and wealthiest and the poorest and sickest American neighborhoods. If you are poor, where you live in America can dictate when you die. It doesn\u2019t need to be this way; such divisions are not inevitable. Ansell calls out the social and cultural arguments that have been raised as ways of explaining or excusing these gaps, and he lays bare the structural violence\u2014the racism, economic exploitation, and discrimination\u2014that is really to blame. Inequality is a disease, Ansell argues, and we need to treat and eradicate it as we would any major illness. To do so, he outlines a vision that will provide the foundation for a healthier nation\u2014for all. Inequality is all around us, and often the distance between high and low life expectancy can be a matter of just a few blocks. But geography need not be destiny, urges Ansell.

Written in both literary Chinese and vernacular Korean, the writings collected here range from royal public edicts to private letters, a fascinating array that blurs the line between classical and everyday language and the divisions between men and women. Haboush's selections also recast the relationship between epistolography and the concept of public and private space. Haboush groups her epistles according to where they were written and read: public letters, letters to colleagues and friends, social letters, and family letters. Then she arranges them according to occasion: letters on leaving home, deathbed letters, letters of fiction, and letters to the dead. She examines the mechanics of epistles, their communicative space, and their cultural and political meaning. With its wholly unique collection of materials, Epistolary Korea produces more than a vivid chronicle of pre- and early modern Korean life. It breaks new ground in establishing the terms of a distinct, non-European form of epistolography.", "page_count": 464, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIEA2091-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-231-14967-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780231149679", "isbn10": "0231149670", "title": "Twenty-first Century Motherhood: Experience, Identity, Policy, Agency", "author": "[\"Andrea O'reilly\"]", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/79/9780231149679.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 35.0, "bookstore_used_price": 26.12, "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "date": "2010", "description": "A Pioneer Of Modern Motherhood Studies, Andrea O'reilly Explores Motherhood's Current Representation And Practice, Considering Developments That Were Unimaginable Decades Ago: The Internet, Interracial Surrogacy, Raising Transchildren, Male Mothering, Intensive Mothering, Queer Parenting, The Applications Of New Biotechnologies, And Mothering In The Post-9/11 Era.

However, this sweeping history covering 4,000 years of international relations from the perspective of China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia shows that the region's extensive involvement in world affairs began thousands of years ago. In a time when the writing of history is increasingly specialized, Warren I. Cohen has made a bold move against the grain. In broad but revealing brushstrokes, he paints a huge canvas of East Asia's place in world affairs throughout four millennia. Just as Cohen thinks broadly across time, so too, he defines the boundaries of East Asia liberally, looking beyond China, Japan, and Korea to include Southeast Asia. In addition, Cohen stretches the scope of international relations beyond its usual limitations to consider the vital role of cultural and economic exchanges. Within this vast framework, Cohen explores the system of Chinese domination in the ancient world, the exchanges between East Asia and the Islamic world from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, and the emergence of a European-defined international system in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The book covers the new imperialism of the 1890s, the Manchurian crisis of the early 1930s, the ascendancy of Japan, the trials of World War II, the drama of the Cold War, and the fleeting \"Asian Century\" from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. East Asia at the Center is replete with often-overlooked or little-known facts, such as: A record of persistent Chinese imperialism in the region Tibet's status as a major power from the 7th to the 9th centuries C.E., when it frequently invaded China and decimated Chinese armies Japan's profound dependence on Korea for its early cultural development The enormous influence of Indian cuisine on that of China Egyptian and Ottoman military aid to their Muslim brethren in India and Sumatra against European powers Extensive Chinese sea voyages to Arabia and East Africa\u2014long before such famous Westerners as Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus took to the seas East Asia at the Center's expansive historical view puts the trials and advances of the past four millennia into perspective, showing that East Asia has often been preeminent on the world stage\u2014and conjecturing that it might be so again in the not-so-distant future.", "page_count": 528, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIEA3162-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-252-07272-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780252072727", "isbn10": "0252072723", "title": "The Unlevel Playing Field: A Documentary History of the African American Experience in Sport", "author": "['David Kenneth Wiggins', 'Patrick B.

Her meta-ethnography reveals surprising patterns of similarity between unrelated cultures.

In Blueprint, behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin describes how the DNA revolution has made DNA personal by giving us the power to predict our psychological strengths and weaknesses from birth. A century of genetic research shows that DNA differences inherited from our parents are the consistent life-long sources of our psychological individuality\u2014the blueprint that makes us who we are. This, says Plomin, is a game changer. Plomin has been working on these issues for almost fifty years, conducting longitudinal studies of twins and adoptees. He reports that genetics explains more of the psychological differences among people than all other factors combined. Genetics accounts for fifty percent of psychological differences\u2014not just mental health and school achievement but all psychological traits, from personality to intellectual abilities. Nature, not nurture is what makes us who we are.

These works are often produced by collectives or come out of a community context; they emphasize participation, dialogue, and action, and appear in situations ranging from theater to activism to urban planning to visual art to health care. Engaged with the texture of living, these art works often blur the line between art and life. This book offers the first global portrait of a complex and exciting mode of cultural production--one that has virtually redefined contemporary art practice. Living as Form grew out of a major exhibition at Creative Time in New York City. Like the exhibition, the book is a landmark survey of more than 100 projects selected by a thirty-person curatorial advisory team; each project is documented by a selection of color images. The artists include the Danish collective Superflex, who empower communities to challenge corporate interest; Turner Prize nominee Jeremy Deller, creator of socially and politically charged performance works; Women on Waves, who provide abortion services and information to women in regions where the procedure is illegal; and Santi\ufffdgo Cirugeda, an architect who builds temporary structures to solve housing problems. Living as Form contains commissioned essays from noted critics and theorists who look at this phenomenon from a global perspective and broaden the range of what constitutes this form.

Known as el Nuevo Cine (the New Cinema), these films presented alienated characters caught in a painful transition period in which old family, gender, and social roles have ceased to function without being replaced by viable new ones. These are the films explored by Charles Ram\u00edrez Berg in Cinema of Solitude, the first book-length critical study of Mexican cinema in English. Berg discusses the major films and filmmakers of el Nuevo Cine in depth. He analyzes dozens of commercial movies, from popular comedies and adventures to award-winning films. Introductory chapters address the issue of mexicanidad (Mexican national identity) and outline Mexican history, the history of film as popular culture and as a leading national industry, and the ideological dynamics of Mexican cinema. In thematically arranged chapters, Berg investigates the images of women, men, and social structures portrayed in New Cinema films. He finds that women characters have begun to reject traditional stereotypes for more positive images, while male characters have grown ambiguous and undefined as machismo is abandoned. Other chapters trace the continuing marginalization of Indians in Mexican culture, the changes in male dominance within the family, and the disruptive social and economic effects caused by migration.

This ambitious and even-handed analysis counters numerous misconceptions about the presidency and fairly demonstrates that the office was seen as monarchical from its inception.\"", "page_count": 464, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["LAW7070-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-300-20826-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780300208269", "isbn10": "030020826X", "title": "The Politics of Empire at the Accession of George III: The East India Company and the Crisis and Transformation of Britain's Imperial State", "author": "['James M.

In this bold debut work, historian James M. Vaughn challenges the scholarly consensus that British India and the Second Empire were founded \"in a fit of absence of mind.\" He instead argues that the origins of the Raj and the largest empire of the modern world were rooted in political conflicts and movements in Britain. It was British conservatives who shaped the Second Empire into one of conquest and dominion, emphasizing the extraction of resources and the subjugation of colonial populations. Drawing on a wide array of sources, Vaughn shows how the East India Company was transformed from a corporation into an imperial power in the service of British political forces opposed to the rising radicalism of the period. The Company's dominion in Bengal, where it raised territorial revenue and maintained a large army, was an autocratic bulwark of Britain's established order. A major work of political and imperial history, this volume offers an important new understanding of the era and its global ramifications.", "page_count": 320, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIST3559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-300-21724-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780300217247", "isbn10": "0300217242", "title": "Rooted Cosmopolitans: Jews and Human Rights in the Twentieth Century", "author": "['James Loeffler']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vMJUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vMJUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 32.5, "bookstore_used_price": 24.4, "publisher": "Yale University Press", "date": "2018-05-04", "description": "A stunningly original look at the forgotten Jewish political roots of contemporary international human rights, told through the moving stories of five key activists The year 2018 marks the seventieth anniversary of two momentous events in twentieth-century history: the birth of the State of Israel and the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Both remain tied together in the ongoing debates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, global antisemitism, and American foreign policy.

In this riveting account, James Loeffler explores this controversial history through the stories of five remarkable Jewish founders of international human rights, following them from the prewar shtetls of eastern Europe to the postwar United Nations, a journey that includes the Nuremberg and Eichmann trials, the founding of Amnesty International, and the UN resolution of 1975 labeling Zionism as racism.

Because women typically inherited more slaves than land, enslaved people were often their primary source of wealth. Not only did white women often refuse to cede ownership of their slaves to their husbands, they employed management techniques that were as effective and brutal as those used by slave\u2011owning men. White women actively participated in the slave market, profited from it, and used it for economic and social empowerment.

Companies like Uber and Airbnb have redefined the way we live. And while they have become pervasive in our day-to-day lives, they are not universally celebrated. They are the result of a generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who used technology to upend convention and disrupt entire industries.

The shift toward automation is about to create a tsunami of unemployment. Not in the distant future--now. One recent estimate predicts 45 million American workers will lose their jobs within the next twelve years--jobs that won't be replaced. In a future marked by restlessness and chronic unemployment, what will happen to American society? In The War on Normal People, Andrew Yang paints a dire portrait of the American economy. Rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and automation software are making millions of Americans' livelihoods irrelevant. The consequences of these trends are already being felt across our communities in the form of political unrest, drug use, and other social ills. The future looks dire-but is it unavoidable? In The War on Normal People, Yang imagines a different future--one in which having a job is distinct from the capacity to prosper and seek fulfillment. At this vision's core is Universal Basic Income, the concept of providing all citizens with a guaranteed income-and one that is rapidly gaining popularity among forward-thinking politicians and economists. Yang proposes that UBI is an essential step toward a new, more durable kind of economy, one he calls \"human capitalism.\"", "page_count": 304, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["COMM4559-7"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-316-48663-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780316486637", "isbn10": "0316486639", "title": "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators", "author": "['Ronan Farrow']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3YGfxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3YGfxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 30.0, "bookstore_used_price": 22.5, "publisher": "Little, Brown", "date": "2019-10-15", "description": "In this instant New York Times bestselling account of violence and espionage, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Ronan Farrow exposes serial abusers and a cabal of powerful interests hell-bent on covering up the truth, at any cost. In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood's most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance they could not explain -- until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood to Washington and beyond. This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement. Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, Catch and Kill breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook our culture.

The anthology explores often overlooked and excluded identities, with pieces on sexuality and disabilities, survivors of assault, sex work as women of color, kink and BDSM, being Muslim and queer, reproductive rights, and the challenges of culture and identity when grappling with gender fluidity and gendered expectations. As they trace the negative effects of a restrictive, fear-based sex education - particularly on marginalized individuals - these stories unearth larger themes: tensions with race and religion, expectations from heteronormative society, and pressures of femininity and masculinity.

For decades this elite would uphold a political construct, an idea of India grounded in democracy, religious tolerance, economic development, and cultural pluralism.

Smith, Wall Street Journal Frederick Douglass recalled that slaves living along Chesapeake Bay longingly viewed sailing ships as \"freedom\u2019s swift-winged angels.\" In 1813 those angels appeared in the bay as British warships coming to punish the Americans for declaring war on the empire. Over many nights, hundreds of slaves paddled out to the warships seeking protection for their families from the ravages of slavery. The runaways pressured the British admirals into becoming liberators. As guides, pilots, sailors, and marines, the former slaves used their intimate knowledge of the countryside to transform the war. They enabled the British to escalate their onshore attacks and to capture and burn Washington, D.C. Tidewater masters had long dreaded their slaves as \"an internal enemy.\" By mobilizing that enemy, the war ignited the deepest fears of Chesapeake slaveholders. It also alienated Virginians from a national government that had neglected their defense. Instead they turned south, their interests aligning more and more with their section. In 1820 Thomas Jefferson observed of sectionalism: \"Like a firebell in the night [it] awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once the knell of the union.\" The notes of alarm in Jefferson's comment speak of the fear aroused by the recent crisis over slavery in his home state. His vision of a cataclysm to come proved prescient. Jefferson's startling observation registered a turn in the nation\u2019s course, a pivot from the national purpose of the founding toward the threat of disunion. Drawn from new sources, Alan Taylor's riveting narrative re-creates the events that inspired black Virginians, haunted slaveholders, and set the nation on a new and dangerous course.", "page_count": 728, "google_rating": 4.5, "num_reviews": 4, "class_objects": ["HIUS3281-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-393-25393-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780393253931", "isbn10": "0393253937", "title": "A Primer for Poets and Readers of Poetry", "author": "['Gregory Orr']", "req_type": "Optional", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GNdDDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GNdDDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.95, "bookstore_used_price": 0.0, "publisher": "W.

Virginians drafted not only the Declaration but also the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; they were elected to the presidency of the United States under that Constitution for thirty-two of the first thirty-six years of its existence. They were all slaveholders. In the new preface Edmund S. Morgan writes: \"Human relations among us still suffer from the former enslavement of a large portion of our predecessors. The freedom of the free, the growth of freedom experienced in the American Revolution depended more than we like to admit on the enslavement of more than 20 percent of us at that time. How republican freedom came to be supported, at least in large part, by its opposite, slavery, is the subject of this book. American Slavery, American Freedom is a study of the tragic contradiction at the core of America.

Rising above misinformation and moralizing, Lisa Wade offers the definitive account of this new sexual culture and demonstrates that the truth is both more heartening and more harrowing than we thought. Offering invaluable insights for parents, educators, and students, Wade situates hookup culture within the history of sexuality, the evolution of higher education, and the unfinished feminist revolution. Using new research, she maps out a punishing emotional landscape marked by unequal pleasures, competition for status, and sexual violence. She discovers that the most privileged students tend to like hookup culture the most, and she considers its effects on racial and sexual minorities, students who \"opt out,\" and those who participate ambivalently. Accessible and open-minded, compassionate and brutally honest, American Hookup explains where we are and how we got here, asking not 'How do we go back?' but 'Where do we go from here?'\"--Hardcover jacket.", "page_count": 304, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["SOC1010-100", "WGS2100-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-393-35617-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780393356175", "isbn10": "0393356175", "title": "The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations", "author": "['Christopher Lasch']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wusGtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wusGtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 17.95, "bookstore_used_price": 13.5, "publisher": "W.

With a declining Virginia yielding to commercially vibrant northern states, Jefferson in 1819 proposed to build a university to educate and improve the sons of the planter elite. They, he hoped, might one day lead a revitalized Virginia free of slavery-- and free of the former slaves. Jefferson's campaign to build the university was a contest for the future of a state and the larger nation.

In this sweeping collection of new and selected essays, Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America's \"first white president.\" But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period--and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation's old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective--the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president. We Were Eight Years in Power features Coates's iconic essays first published in The Atlantic, including \"Fear of a Black President,\" \"The Case for Reparations,\" and \"The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration,\" along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates's own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era.

Craven Prize from the Organization of American Historians Winner of the 2015 Sidney Hillman Prize Americans tend to cast slavery as a pre-modern institution--the nation's original sin, perhaps, but isolated in time and divorced from America's later success. But to do so robs the millions who suffered in bondage of their full legacy. As historian Edward E. Baptist reveals in The Half Has Never Been Told, the expansion of slavery in the first eight decades after American independence drove the evolution and modernization of the United States. In the span of a single lifetime, the South grew from a narrow coastal strip of worn-out tobacco plantations to a continental cotton empire, and the United States grew into a modern, industrial, and capitalist economy. Told through intimate slave narratives, plantation records, newspapers, and the words of politicians, entrepreneurs, and escaped slaves, The Half Has Never Been Told offers a radical new interpretation of American history.

And yet, crime rates have plummeted, making life in America safer than ever. Why, then, are Americans so afraid-and where does this fear lead to? In this remarkable work of social history, Elaine Tyler May demonstrates how our obsession with security has made citizens fear each other and distrust the government, making America less safe and less democratic.

The title provides an excellent thematic focus. He understood both the necessity, and the impossibility, of being a black 'American' writer. He took these issues 'Beyond'---Paris, Istanbul, various parts of Africa---but this formative experience only returned him to the unresolved dilemmas. He was a fine novelist and a major prophetic political voice. He produced some of the most important essays of the twentieth century and addressed in depth the complexities of the black political movement. His relative invisibility almost lost us one of the most significant voices of his generation. This welcome 'revival' retrieves it. Close call.\" ---Stuart Hall, Professor Emeritus, Open University This interdisciplinary collection by leading writers in their fields brings together a discussion of the many facets of James Baldwin, both as a writer and as the prophetic conscience of a nation. The core of the volume addresses the shifting, complex relations between Baldwin as an American\u2014\u201cas American as any Texas GI\u201d as he once wryly put it\u2014and his life as an itinerant cosmopolitan. His ambivalent imaginings of America were always mediated by his conception of a world \u201cbeyond\u201d America: a world he knew both from his travels and from his voracious reading. He was a man whose instincts were, at every turn, nurtured by America; but who at the same time developed a ferocious critique of American exceptionalism. In seeking to understand how, as an American, he could learn to live with difference\u2014breaking the power of fundamentalisms of all stripes\u2014he opened an urgent, timely debate that is still ours. His America was an idea fired by desire and grief in equal measure. As the authors assembled here argue, to read him now allows us to imagine new possibilities for the future.

The author of Castaways (Naufragios), Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, was a fortune-seeking nobleman and the treasurer of an expedition to claim for Spain a vast area that includes today's Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. A shipwreck forced him and a handful of men to make the long westward journey on foot to meet up with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. In order to survive, Cabeza de Vaca joined native peoples along the way, learning their languages and practices and serving them as a slave and later as a physician. When after eight years he finally reached the West, he was not recognized by his compatriots. In his writing Cabeza de Vaca displays great interest in the cultures of the native peoples he encountered on his odyssey. As he forged intimate bonds with some of them, sharing their brutal living conditions and curing their sick, he found himself on a voyage of self-discovery that was to make his reunion with his fellow Spaniards less joyful than expected. Cabeza de Vaca's gripping narrative is a trove of ethnographic information, with descriptions and interpretations of native cultures that make it a powerful precursor to modern anthropology.

During the journey, as-Saffar took careful notes and upon his return he hurriedly wrote this travel account. Why was the sultan, descendent of the Prophet Muhammad, and head of a dynasty that had ruled Morocco for more than two hundred years, so eager to read this account? Perhaps he thought it would illuminate some troubling matters: how the French acquired their power and their mastery over nature; how they led their daily lives, educated their children, treated their women and servants. In short, the sultan wanted to know the condition of French civilization and why it differed from his. As-Saffar provided the answers. Moreover, as we read the account, Muhammad as-Saffar comes alive for us. We see him reflecting on the beauty of women, contorting during his ritual ablutions, and suffering from boredom at endless dinners. His opinions and ideas infuse every page. For him the journey was more than a catalog of curiosities; it was a transforming experience. Given our very limited knowledge of the time and the absence of other voices that speak with equal clarity, this travel account enlarges our understanding of the relationship between nineteenth-century Morocco and France.", "page_count": 244, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["MEST4991-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-520-20671-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780520206717", "isbn10": "0520206711", "title": "The Myth of Wild Africa: Conservation Without Illusion", "author": "['Jonathan S.

Rather, it is a story of the assemblage of disparate elements - adapted from fields such as civil defense, emergency management and international public health - by well-meaning experts and officials, and of response failures that have typically led, in turn, to reforms that seek to strengthen or refocus the apparatus. The analysis centers on the ways that authorities - whether public health officials, national security experts, life scientists, or other privileged observers - conceptualize and act on an encroaching future of disease emergence. This uncertain future can be taken up and made into an object of present intervention according to multiple rationalities: as an object of probabilistic calculation, as a specter that must be avoided through precautionary intervention, or as a potential catastrophe that cannot be evaded but can only be prepared for.

If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, \"500-year\" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually. This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century. In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today. Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring before it, The Uninhabitable Earth is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action.

For centuries, from the pre-Columbian era through the 1840s, Native Americans took prisoners of war and killed, adopted, or enslaved them. Christina Snyder's pathbreaking book takes a familiar setting for bondage, the American South, and places Native Americans at the center of her engrossing story. Indian warriors captured a wide range of enemies, including Africans, Europeans, and other Indians. Yet until the late eighteenth century, age and gender more than race affected the fate of captives. As economic and political crises mounted, however, Indians began to racialize slavery and target African Americans. Native people struggling to secure a separate space for themselves in America developed a shared language of race with white settlers. Although the Indians' captivity practices remained fluid long after their neighbors hardened racial lines, the Second Seminole War ultimately tore apart the inclusive communities that Native people had created through centuries of captivity. Snyder's rich and sweeping history of Indian slavery connects figures like Andrew Jackson and Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe with little-known captives like Antonia Bonnelli, a white teenager from Spanish Florida, and David George, a black runaway from Virginia. Placing the experiences of these individuals within a complex system of captivity and Indians' relations with other peoples, Snyder demonstrates the profound role of Native American history in the American past.", "page_count": 329, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS7021-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-674-07234-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780674072343", "isbn10": "0674072340", "title": "Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor", "author": "['Rob Nixon']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=61qJNAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=61qJNAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 22.5, "bookstore_used_price": 15.75, "publisher": "", "date": "2013-03-01", "description": "Original publication and copyright date: 2011.", "page_count": 353, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLCP4500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-674-23745-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780674237452", "isbn10": "0674237455", "title": "Bound in Wedlock: Slave and Free Black Marriage in the Nineteenth Century", "author": "['Tera W.

But as Cemil Aydin explains in this provocative history, it is a misconception to think that the world's 1.5 billion Muslims constitute a single religio-political entity. How did this belief arise, and why is it so widespread? The Idea of the Muslim World searches for the intellectual origins of a mistaken notion and explains its enduring allure for non-Muslims and Muslims alike. Conceived as the antithesis of Western Christian civilization, the idea of the Muslim world emerged in the late nineteenth century, when European empires ruled the majority of Muslims. It was inflected from the start by theories of white supremacy, but Muslims had a hand in shaping the idea as well. Aydin reveals the role of Muslim intellectuals in envisioning and essentializing an idealized pan-Islamic society that refuted claims of Muslims' racial and civilizational inferiority. After playing a key role in the politics of the Ottoman Caliphate, the idea of the Muslim world survived decolonization and the Cold War, and took on new force in the late twentieth century. Standing at the center of both Islamophobic and pan-Islamic ideologies, the idea of the Muslim world continues to hold the global imagination in a grip that will need to be loosened in order to begin a more fruitful discussion about politics in Muslim societies today.--", "page_count": 304, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLPT8500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-674-36408-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780674364080", "isbn10": "0674364082", "title": "Growing Up With A Single Parent: What Hurts, What Helps", "author": "['Sara Mclanahan', 'Gary D.

For far too long, the history of how American women won the right to vote has been told as the tale of a few iconic leaders, all white and native-born. But Susan Ware uncovered a much broader and more diverse story waiting to be told. Why They Marched is a tribute to the many women who worked tirelessly in communities across the nation, out of the spotlight, protesting, petitioning, and insisting on their right to full citizenship. Ware tells her story through the lives of nineteen activists, most of whom have long been overlooked. We meet Mary Church Terrell, a multilingual African American woman; Rose Schneiderman, a labor activist building coalitions on New York's Lower East Side; Claiborne Catlin, who toured the Massachusetts countryside on horseback to drum up support for the cause; Mary Johnston, an aristocratic novelist bucking the Southern ruling elite; Emmeline W. Wells, a Mormon woman in a polygamous marriage determined to make her voice heard; and others who helped harness a groundswell of popular support. We also see the many places where the suffrage movement unfolded--in church parlors, meeting rooms, and the halls of Congress, but also on college campuses and even at the top of Mount Rainier. Few corners of the United States were untouched by suffrage activism. Ware's deeply moving stories provide a fresh account of one of the most significant moments of political mobilization in American history. The dramatic, often joyous experiences of these women resonate powerfully today, as a new generation of young women demands to be heard.", "page_count": 320, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["WGS4559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-679-72722-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780679727224", "isbn10": "0679727221", "title": "The Defense: A Novel", "author": "['Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov', 'Michael Scammell']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8HGb31KVsxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8HGb31KVsxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.95, "bookstore_used_price": 8.43, "publisher": "Vintage", "date": "1990", "description": "Luzhin's prodigious talent at chess earns him the title of grandmaster, but his passion soon leads to obsession, and his world falls apart during a championship match when his defense fades under his opponent's surprising strategy.", "page_count": 256, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RUTR3400-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-679-73450-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780679734505", "isbn10": "0679734503", "title": "Crime and Punishment: A Novel in Six Parts With Epilogue", "author": "['Fyodor M.

Rashomon, which won both the Venice Film Festival's grand prize and an Academy Award for best foreign-language film, helped ignite Western interest in the Japanese cinema. Seven Samurai and Yojimbo remain enormously popular both in Japan and abroad. In this newly revised and expanded edition of his study of Kurosawa's films, Stephen Prince provides two new chapters that examine Kurosawa's remaining films, placing him in the context of cinema history. Prince also discusses how Kurosawa furnished a template for some well-known Hollywood directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas. Providing a new and comprehensive look at this master filmmaker, The Warrior's Camera probes the complex visual structure of Kurosawa's work. The book shows how Kurosawa attempted to symbolize on film a course of national development for post-war Japan, and it traces the ways that he tied his social visions to a dynamic system of visual and narrative forms. The author analyzes Kurosawa's entire career and places the films in context by drawing on the director's autobiography--a fascinating work that presents Kurosawa as a Kurosawa character and the story of his life as the kind of spiritual odyssey witnessed so often in his films. After examining the development of Kurosawa's visual style in his early work, The Warrior's Camera explains how he used this style in subsequent films to forge a politically committed model of filmmaking. It then demonstrates how the collapse of Kurosawa's efforts to participate as a filmmaker in the tasks of social reconstruction led to the very different cinematic style evident in his most recent films, works of pessimism that view the world as resistant to change.", "page_count": 417, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 3, "class_objects": ["HIEA2559-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-691-01103-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691011035", "isbn10": "0691011036", "title": "A Space on the Side of the Road: Cultural Poetics in an \"other\" America", "author": "['Kathleen Stewart']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G5aoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G5aoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 46.0, "bookstore_used_price": 34.33, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "date": "1996-03-07", "description": "This text portrays an \"other\" America that survives among the ruins of the West Virginia coal camps and \"hollers\".

Here Yoshikuni Igarashi offers a provocative look at how Japanese postwar society struggled to understand its war loss and the resulting national trauma, even as forces within the society sought to suppress these memories. Igarashi argues that Japan's nationhood survived the war's destruction in part through a popular culture that expressed memories of loss and devastation more readily than political discourse ever could. He shows how the desire to represent the past motivated Japan's cultural productions in the first twenty-five years of the postwar period. Japanese war experiences were often described through narrative devices that downplayed the war's disruptive effects on Japan's history. Rather than treat these narratives as obstacles to historical inquiry, Igarashi reads them along with counter-narratives that attempted to register the original impact of the war. He traces the tensions between remembering and forgetting by focusing on the body as the central site for Japan's production of the past. This approach leads to fascinating discussions of such diverse topics as the use of the atomic bomb, hygiene policies under the U.S. occupation, the monstrous body of Godzilla, the first Western professional wrestling matches in Japan, the transformation of Tokyo and the athletic body for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the writer Yukio Mishima's dramatic suicide, while providing a fresh critical perspective on the war legacy of Japan.", "page_count": 284, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["HIEA3559-1", "HIEA4501-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-691-12609-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691126098", "isbn10": "0691126097", "title": "Barbershops, Bibles, And Bet: Everyday Talk And Black Political Thought", "author": "['Melissa Victoria Harris-lacewell']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/98/9780691126098.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 37.5, "bookstore_used_price": 27.99, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "date": "", "description": "", "page_count": 0, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLAP4150-1", "PLAP7500-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-691-13576-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780691135762", "isbn10": "0691135762", "title": "Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers", "author": "['Karl Johan Astr\u00f6m', 'Richard M.

Liberals argue that the benefits of trade give states an incentive to stay peaceful. Realists contend that trade compels states to struggle for vital raw materials and markets.

Taking a broad look at cases spanning two centuries, from the Napoleonic and Crimean wars to the more recent Cold War crises, Dale Copeland demonstrates that when leaders have positive expectations of the future trade environment, they want to remain at peace in order to secure the economic benefits that enhance long-term power. When, however, these expectations turn negative, leaders are likely to fear a loss of access to raw materials and markets, giving them more incentive to initiate crises to protect their commercial interests. The theory of trade expectations holds important implications for the understanding of Sino-American relations since 1985 and for the direction these relations will likely take over the next two decades.

Contending that democracy has never been for all people, Hanchard discusses how marginalization is reinforced in modern politics, and why these contradictions need to be fully examined if the dynamics of democracy are to be truly understood. Hanchard identifies continuities of discriminatory citizenship from classical Athens to the present and looks at how democratic institutions have promoted undemocratic ideas and practices. The longest-standing modern democracies--France, Britain, and the United States\u2014profited from slave labor, empire, and colonialism, much like their Athenian predecessor. Hanchard follows these patterns through the Enlightenment and to the states and political thinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and he examines how early political scientists, including Woodrow Wilson and his contemporaries, devised what Hanchard has characterized as \"racial regimes\" to maintain the political and economic privileges of dominant groups at the expense of subordinated ones. Exploring how democracies reconcile political inequality and equality, Hanchard debates the thorny question of the conditions under which democracies have created and maintained barriers to political membership.

In this trenchant book, Brennan argues that democracy should be judged by its results\u2014and the results are not good enough. Just as defendants have a right to a fair trial, citizens have a right to competent government. But democracy is the rule of the ignorant and the irrational, and it all too often falls short.

In Censored, Margaret Roberts demonstrates that even censorship that is easy to circumvent can still be enormously effective. Taking advantage of digital data harvested from the Chinese Internet and leaks from China's Propaganda Department, this important book sheds light on how and when censorship influences the Chinese public. Roberts finds that much of censorship in China works not by making information impossible to access but by requiring those seeking information to spend extra time and money for access. By inconveniencing users, censorship diverts the attention of citizens and powerfully shapes the spread of information. When Internet users notice blatant censorship, they are willing to compensate for better access. But subtler censorship, such as burying search results or introducing distracting information on the web, is more effective because users are less aware of it. Roberts challenges the conventional wisdom that online censorship is undermined when it is incomplete and shows instead how censorship's porous nature is used strategically to divide the public. Drawing parallels between censorship in China and the way information is manipulated in the United States and other democracies, Roberts reveals how Internet users are susceptible to control even in the most open societies.

Tracing the history and philosophy of science from the late nineteenth century to today, Oreskes explains that, contrary to popular belief, there is no single scientific method.

This process is not perfect\u2014nothing ever is when humans are involved\u2014but she draws vital lessons from cases where scientists got it wrong.

Rather than focusing on a leader's background, beliefs, bargaining skills, or biases, Yarhi-Milo draws a systematic link between a trait called self-monitoring and foreign policy behavior. She examines self-monitoring among national leaders and advisers and shows that while high self-monitors modify their behavior strategically to cultivate image-enhancing status, low self-monitors are less likely to change their behavior in response to reputation concerns. Exploring self-monitoring through case studies of foreign policy crises during the terms of U.S. presidents Carter, Reagan, and Clinton, Yarhi-Milo disproves the notion that hawks are always more likely than doves to fight for reputation. Instead, Yarhi-Milo demonstrates that a decision maker's propensity for impression management is directly associated with the use of force to restore a reputation for resolve on the international stage.

In The Presidency of Barack Obama, Julian Zelizer gathers leading American historians to put President Obama and his administration into political and historical context. These writers offer strikingly original assessments of the big issues that shaped the Obama years, including the conservative backlash, race, the financial crisis, health care, crime, drugs, counterterrorism, Iraq and Afghanistan, the environment, immigration, education, gay rights, and urban policy. Together, these essays suggest that Obama's central paradox is that, despite effective policymaking, he failed to receive credit for his many achievements and wasn't a party builder. Provocatively, they ask why Obama didn't unite Democrats and progressive activists to fight the conservative counter-tide as it grew stronger.

Did the American regime of racial oppression in any way inspire the Nazis? The unsettling answer is yes. In Hitler's American Model, James Whitman presents a detailed investigation of the American impact on the notorious Nuremberg Laws, the centerpiece anti-Jewish legislation of the Nazi regime. Contrary to those who have insisted that there was no meaningful connection between American and German racial repression, Whitman demonstrates that the Nazis took a real, sustained, significant, and revealing interest in American race policies. As Whitman shows, the Nuremberg Laws were crafted in an atmosphere of considerable attention to the precedents American race laws had to offer. German praise for American practices, already found in Hitler's Mein Kampf, was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and the most radical Nazi lawyers were eager advocates of the use of American models. But while Jim Crow segregation was one aspect of American law that appealed to Nazi radicals, it was not the most consequential one. Rather, both American citizenship and anti-miscegenation laws proved directly relevant to the two principal Nuremberg Laws--the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. Whitman looks at the ultimate, ugly irony that when Nazis rejected American practices, it was sometimes not because they found them too enlightened, but too harsh.

Though we may laud wealthy individuals who give away their money for society\u2019s benefit, Just Giving shows how such generosity not only isn\u2019t the unassailable good we think it to be but might also undermine democratic values and set back aspirations of justice. Big philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable, often perpetual, and lavishly tax-advantaged. The affluent\u2014and their foundations\u2014reap vast benefits even as they influence policy without accountability. And small philanthropy, or ordinary charitable giving, can be problematic as well. Charity, it turns out, does surprisingly little to provide for those in need and sometimes worsens inequality. These outcomes are shaped by the policies that define and structure philanthropy. When, how much, and to whom people give is influenced by laws governing everything from the creation of foundations and nonprofits to generous tax exemptions for donations of money and property. Rob Reich asks: What attitude and what policies should democracies have concerning individuals who give money away for public purposes? Philanthropy currently fails democracy in many ways, but Reich argues that it can be redeemed. Differentiating between individual philanthropy and private foundations, the aims of mass giving should be the decentralization of power in the production of public goods, such as the arts, education, and science. For foundations, the goal should be what Reich terms \u201cdiscovery,\u201d or long-time-horizon innovations that enhance democratic experimentalism.

For nearly a hundred years, from the mid-nineteenth century onward, countless American women fought for the right to vote. While some of the leading figures of the suffrage movement have received deserved appreciation, the crusade for women\u2019s enfranchisement involved many individuals, each with a unique story to be told. Weaving together a diverse collection of portraits and other visual materials\u2014including photographs, drawings, paintings, prints, textiles, and mixed media\u2014along with biographical narratives and trenchant essays, this comprehensive book presents fresh perspectives on the history of the movement. Bringing attention to underrecognized individuals and groups, the leading historians featured here look at how suffragists used portraiture to promote gender equality and other feminist ideals, and how photographic portraits in particular proved to be a crucial element of women\u2019s activism and recruitment. The contributors also explore the reasons why certain events and leaders of the suffrage movement have been remembered over others, the obstacles that black women faced when organizing with white suffragists and the subsequent founding of black women\u2019s suffrage groups, the foundations of the violent antisuffrage movement, and the ways suffragists held up American women physicians who served in France during World War I as exemplary citizens, deserving the right to vote.

Then the discovery of gold challenged that way of life and led finally to the infamous massacre at Sand Creek and the Indian Wars of the late 1860s. Illuminating both the ancient and more recent history of the plains and eastern Rocky Mountains, West creates a tapestry interlaced with environmental, social, and military history. He treats the \"frontier\" not as a morally loaded term, either in the traditional celebratory sense or the more recent critical judgment, but as a powerfully unsettling process that shattered an old world.

It's a marvel.\" - Paula Hawkins From the bestselling author of Everything I Never Told You, a riveting novel that traces the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and the enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives. In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned - from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules. Enter Mia Warren - an enigmatic artist and single mother - who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community. When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs. Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood - and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.

[Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt is] a genius.\"--Trevor Noah, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah \"This book should be required reading for everyone.\"--Robin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility As featured on CBS This Morning, NPR's All Things Considered, TIME Magazine, and Democracy Now! You don't have to be racist to be biased. Unconscious bias can be at work without our realizing it, and even when we genuinely wish to treat all people equally, ingrained stereotypes can infect our visual perception, attention, memory, and behavior. This has an impact on education, employment, housing, and criminal justice. In Biased, with a perspective that is at once scientific, investigative, and informed by personal experience, Jennifer Eberhardt offers us insights into the dilemma and a path forward. Eberhardt works extensively as a consultant to law enforcement and as a psychologist at the forefront of this new field. Her research takes place in courtrooms and boardrooms, in prisons, on the street, and in classrooms and coffee shops. She shows us the subtle--and sometimes dramatic--daily repercussions of implicit bias in how teachers grade students, or managers deal with customers. It has an enormous impact on the conduct of criminal justice, from the rapid decisions police officers have to make to sentencing practices in court. Eberhardt's work and her book are both influenced by her own life, and the personal stories she shares emphasize the need for change. She has helped companies that include Airbnb and Nextdoor address bias in their business practices and has led anti-bias initiatives for police departments across the country. Here, she offers practical suggestions for reform and new practices that are useful for organizations as well as individuals. Unblinking about the tragic consequences of prejudice, Eberhardt addresses how racial bias is not the fault of nor restricted to a few \"bad apples\" but is present at all levels of society in media, education, and business. The good news is that we are not hopelessly doomed by our innate prejudices. In Biased, Eberhardt reminds us that racial bias is a human problem--one all people can play a role in solving.", "page_count": 352, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["LAW9089-5"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-7356-1131-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780735611313", "isbn10": "0735611319", "title": "Code: the hidden language of computer hardware and software", "author": "['Charles Petzold']", "req_type": "Recommended", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gYlQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gYlQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 29.99, "bookstore_used_price": 22.39, "publisher": "Microsoft Pr", "date": "2000-10-18", "description": "A discussion of the history and future of coding theory celebrates the ingenuity of language systems and their uses from Braille and Morse code through binary codes to 32-bit operating systems.", "page_count": 393, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 10, "class_objects": ["MDST4803-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-7425-5405-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780742554054", "isbn10": "0742554058", "title": "Lies that Bind: Chinese Truth, Other Truths", "author": "['Susan Debra Blum']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ormwnXOdNfcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ormwnXOdNfcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 44.0, "bookstore_used_price": 32.84, "publisher": "Rowman & Littlefield", "date": "2007", "description": "This provocative book explores the ideology of truth and deception in China, offering a nuanced perspective on social interaction in different cultural settings. Drawing on decades of fieldwork in China, Susan D. Blum offers an authoritative examination of rules, expectations, and beliefs regarding lying and honesty in society. Blum points to a propensity for deception in Chinese public interactions in situations where people in the United States would expect truthfulness, yet argues that lying is evaluated within Chinese society by moral standards different from those of Americans. Chinese, for example, might emphasize the consequences of speech, Americans the absolute truthfulness. Blum considers the longstanding values that led to this style of interaction, as well as more recent factors, such as the government's control over expression. But Chinese society is not alone in the practice of such customs. The author observes that many Americans also excel in manipulation of language, yet find a simultaneous moral absolutism opposed to lying in any form. She also considers other traditions, including Japanese and Jewish, that struggle to control the boundaries of lying, balancing human needs with moral values in contrasting ways.

In this new consumer society, individuals become simultaneously the promoters of commodities and the commodities they promote. They are, at one and the same time, the merchandise and the marketer, the goods and the travelling salespeople. They all inhabit the same social space that is customarily described by the term the market. The test they need to pass in order to acquire the social prizes they covet requires them to recast themselves as products capable of drawing attention to themselves. This subtle and pervasive transformation of consumers into commodities is the most important feature of the society of consumers. It is the hidden truth, the deepest and most closely guarded secret, of the consumer society in which we now live. In this new book Zygmunt Bauman examines the impact of consumerist attitudes and patterns of conduct on various apparently unconnected aspects of social life politics and democracy, social divisions and stratification, communities and partnerships, identity building, the production and use of knowledge, and value preferences. The invasion and colonization of the web of human relations by the worldviews and behavioural patterns inspired and shaped by commodity markets, and the sources of resentment, dissent and occasional resistance to the occupying forces, are the central themes of this brilliant new book by one of the worlds most original and insightful social thinkers.", "page_count": 168, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["SOC3310-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-7456-7034-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780745670348", "isbn10": "0745670342", "title": "Personal Connections in the Digital Age", "author": "['Nancy K.

In this second edition of her timely and vibrant book, Nancy Baym provides frameworks for thinking critically about the roles of digital media in personal relationships. Rather than providing exuberant accounts or cautionary tales, it offers a data-grounded primer on how to make sense of these important changes in relational life Fully updated to reflect new developments in technology and digital scholarship, the book identifies the core relational issues these media disturb and shows how our talk about them echoes historical discussions about earlier communication technologies. Chapters explore how we use mediated language and nonverbal behavior to develop and maintain communities, social networks, and new relationships, and to maintain existing relationships in our everyday lives. The book combines research findings with lively examples to address questions such as: Can mediated interaction be warm and personal? Are people honest about themselves online? Can relationships that start online work? Do digital media damage the other relationships in our lives? Throughout, the book argues that these questions must be answered with firm understandings of media qualities and the social and personal contexts in which they are developed and used. This new edition of Personal Connections in the Digital Age will be required reading for all students and scholars of media, communication studies, and sociology, as well as all those who want a richer understanding of digital media and everyday life.", "page_count": 240, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["MDST3755-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-7506-3372-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780750633727", "isbn10": "0750633727", "title": "Statistical Physics", "author": "['L.D.

They explore the hidden dynamics that can prevent a group from functioning effectively.

Following his advice, each of us can access and apply the power that lies within us in ways that will change our world for the better.", "page_count": 304, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["GSGS3030-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-7914-1518-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780791415184", "isbn10": "079141518X", "title": "The Need for a Sacred Science", "author": "['Seyyed Hossein Nasr']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kwuLYNur5pwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kwuLYNur5pwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 31.95, "bookstore_used_price": 23.95, "publisher": "SUNY Press", "date": "1993-07-01", "description": "The meaning of a science rooted in the sacred, its contrast to modern science and its pertinence to us today.", "page_count": 187, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["MESA3559-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8014-5652-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780801456527", "isbn10": "0801456525", "title": "By Sword And Plow: France And The Conquest Of Algeria", "author": "['Jennifer E.

In Ruffians, Yakuza, Nationalists, Eiko Maruko Siniawer argues that violence has been embedded in the practice of modern Japanese politics from the very inception of the country's experiment with democracy. As soon as the parliament opened its doors in 1890, brawls, fistfights, vandalism, threats, and intimidation quickly became a fixture in Japanese politics, from campaigns and elections to legislative debates. Most of this physical force was wielded by what Siniawer calls \"violence specialists\": ruffians and yakuza. Their systemic and enduring political violence-in the streets, in the halls of parliament, during popular protests, and amid labor strife-ultimately compromised party politics in Japan and contributed to the rise of militarism in the 1930s. For the post-World War II years, Siniawer illustrates how the Japanese developed a preference for money over violence as a political tool of choice. This change in tactics signaled a political shift, but not necessarily an evolution, as corruption and bribery were in some ways more insidious, exclusionary, and undemocratic than violence. Siniawer demonstrates that the practice of politics in Japan has been dangerous, chaotic, and far more violent than previously thought. Additionally, crime has been more political. Throughout the book, Siniawer makes clear that certain yakuza groups were ideological in nature, contrary to the common understanding of organized crime as nonideological. Ruffians, Yakuza, Nationalists is essential reading for anyone wanting to comprehend the role of violence in the formation of modern nation-states and its place in both democratic and fascist movements.", "page_count": 284, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIEA3559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8014-5689-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780801456893", "isbn10": "0801456894", "title": "42: Inside The Presidency Of Bill Clinton Forty-two 42 (nelson, Perry And Riley) Project Muse Upcc Books", "author": "NELSON, PERRY, & Required", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/93/9780801456893.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 18.71, "bookstore_used_price": 18.75, "publisher": "Cornell University Press, Published In Association With The University Of Virginia's Miller Center,", "date": "", "description": "Politics.

Social reform combatted poverty, crime, and ignorance through new institutions offering nonauthoritarian forms of social control. Radical reform sought to regenerate American society by eliminating fundamental sources of inequality such as slavery and racial and sexual discrimination.

Dissecting a new national survey, Gries shows how ideology powerfully divides Main Street over both domestic and foreign policy and reveals how and why, with the exception of attitudes toward Israel, liberals consistently feel warmer toward foreign countries and international organizations, and desire friendlier policies toward them, than conservatives do. And because most Congressional districts have become hyper-partisan, many politicians today cater not to the \"median voter\" in their districts, but to the primary voters who elect them. The perverse incentives of the U.S. electoral system, therefore, are empowering the ideological extremes, contributing to elite partisanship over American foreign policy. The Politics of American Foreign Policy weaves seamlessly together in-depth examinations of the psychological roots and foreign policy consequences of the liberal-conservative divide, the cultural, socio-racial, economic, and political dimensions of American ideology, and the moral values and foreign policy orientations that divide Democrats and Republicans. Within this context, the book explores in detail why American liberals and conservatives disagree over US policy relating to Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, East Asia, and international organizations such as the UN.", "page_count": 347, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLIR4440-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8050-3149-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780805031492", "isbn10": "0805031499", "title": "Escape from Freedom", "author": "['Erich Fromm']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d2g8L1sLykwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d2g8L1sLykwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 19.0, "bookstore_used_price": 8.95, "publisher": "Macmillan", "date": "1994", "description": "The author analyzes what he considers to be contemporary man's fear of positive freedom and willingness to submit to totalitarianism.", "page_count": 301, "google_rating": 4.5, "num_reviews": 7, "class_objects": ["SOC3310-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8050-9727-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780805097276", "isbn10": "0805097279", "title": "Ronald Reagan: The American Presidents Series: The 40th President, 1981-1989", "author": "['Jacob Weisberg']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rzohCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rzohCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.9, "bookstore_used_price": 10.45, "publisher": "Macmillan", "date": "2016-01-05", "description": "The conservative icon who reshaped American politics and laid the groundwork for the end of the Cold War In the second half of the twentieth century, no American president defined his political era as did Ronald Reagan. He ushered in an age that extolled smaller government, tax cuts, and strong defense, and to this day politicians of both political parties operate within the parameters of the world he made. His eight years in office from 1981 to 1989 were a time of economic crisis and recovery, a new American assertiveness abroad, and an engagement with the Soviet Union that began in conflict but moved in surprising new directions. Jacob Weisberg provides a bracing portrait of America's fortieth president and the ideas that animated his political career, offering a fresh psychological interpretation and showing that there was more to Reagan than the usual stereotypes. Reagan, he observes, was a staunch conservative but was also unafraid to compromise and cut deals where necessary. And Reagan espoused a firm belief, just as firm as his belief in small government and strong defense, that nuclear weapons were immoral and ought to be eliminated. Weisberg argues that these facets of Reagan were too often ignored in his time but reveal why his presidency turned out to be so consequential. In the years since Reagan left office, he has been cast in marble by the Republican Party and dismissed by the Democrats. Weisberg shows why we need to move past these responses if we wish truly to appreciate his accomplishments and his legacy.", "page_count": 208, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 10, "class_objects": ["LAW9007-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8052-0999-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780805209990", "isbn10": "0805209999", "title": "The Trial", "author": "['Franz Kafka']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eenXRYAzQRsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eenXRYAzQRsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 14.95, "bookstore_used_price": 7.43, "publisher": "Random House Digital, Inc.", "date": "1998", "description": "Narrates the experiences and reactions of a respectable bank functionary after his abrupt arrest on an undisclosed charge", "page_count": 276, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 29, "class_objects": ["GETR3590-4"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8070-4741-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780807047415", "isbn10": "0807047414", "title": "White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk about Racism", "author": "['Robin J.

Followed by an angry army of welfare mothers, they stormed the casino hotel Caesars Palace to protest Nevada_s decision to terminate their benefits. The demonstrations went on for weeks, garnering the protesters and their cause national attention. Las Vegas felt the pinch; tourism was cut by half. Ultimately, a federal judge ruled to reinstate benefits. It was a victory for welfare rights advocates across the country.In Storming Caesars Palace, historian Annelise Orleck tells the compelling story of how a group of welfare mothers and their supporters built one of this country_s most successful antipoverty programs. Declaring that \"we can do it and do it better\" these women proved that poor mothers are the real experts on poverty. In 1972 they founded Operation Life, which was responsible for all kinds of firsts for the poor in Las Vegas--the first library, medical center, daycare center, job training, and senior citizen housing. By the late 1970s, Operation Life was bringing millions of dollars into the community each year. And these women were influential in Washington, D.C.--respected and listened to by the likes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Ted Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter.Ultimately, in the 1980s, Ruby Duncan and her band of reformers lost their funding with the country_s move toward conservatism.

From his prison cell at Fort McHenry, Merryman petitioned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney for release through a writ of habeas corpus. Taney issued the writ, but President Abraham Lincoln ignored it. In mid-July Merryman was released, only to be indicted for treason in a Baltimore federal court. His case, however, never went to trial and federal prosecutors finally dismissed it in 1867. In Abraham Lincoln and Treason in the Civil War, Jonathan White reveals how the arrest and prosecution of this little-known Baltimore farmer had a lasting impact on the Lincoln administration and Congress as they struggled to develop policies to deal with both northern traitors and southern rebels.

Sherman occupied Savannah and then marched his armies north through the Carolinas. Although much has been written about the military aspects of Sherman's March, Jacqueline Campbell reveals a more complex story. Integrating evidence from Northern soldiers and from Southern civilians, black and white, male and female, Campbell demonstrates the importance of culture for determining the limits of war and how it is fought. Sherman's March was an invasion of both geographical and psychological space. The Union army viewed the Southern landscape as military terrain. But when they brought war into Southern households, Northern soldiers were frequently astounded by the fierceness with which many white Southern women defended their homes. Campbell argues that in the household-centered South, Confederate women saw both ideological and material reasons to resist. While some Northern soldiers lauded this bravery, others regarded such behavior as inappropriate and unwomanly. Campbell also investigates the complexities behind African Americans' decisions either to stay on the plantation or to flee with Union troops. Black Southerners' delight at the coming of the army of \"emancipation\" often turned to terror as Yankees plundered their homes and assaulted black women. Ultimately, When Sherman Marched North from the Sea calls into question postwar rhetoric that represented the heroic defense of the South as a male prerogative and praised Confederate women for their \"feminine\" qualities of sentimentality, patience, and endurance. Campbell suggests that political considerations underlie this interpretation--that Yankee depredations seemed more outrageous when portrayed as an attack on defenseless women and children. Campbell convincingly restores these women to their role as vital players in the fight for a Confederate nation, as models of self-assertion rather than passive self-sacrifice.", "page_count": 192, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIUS3072-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8078-9888-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780807898888", "isbn10": "0807898880", "title": "The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935", "author": "['James D.

By placing black schooling within a political, cultural, and economic context, he offers fresh insights into black commitment to education, the peculiar significance of Tuskegee Institute, and the conflicting goals of various philanthropic groups, among other matters. Initially, ex-slaves attempted to create an educational system that would support and extend their emancipation, but their children were pushed into a system of industrial education that presupposed black political and economic subordination. This conception of education and social order--supported by northern industrial philanthropists, some black educators, and most southern school officials--conflicted with the aspirations of ex-slaves and their descendants, resulting at the turn of the century in a bitter national debate over the purposes of black education. Because blacks lacked economic and political power, white elites were able to control the structure and content of black elementary, secondary, normal, and college education during the first third of the twentieth century. Nonetheless, blacks persisted in their struggle to develop an educational system in accordance with their own needs and desires.", "page_count": 381, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF7602-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8078-9953-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780807899533", "isbn10": "0807899534", "title": "Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy", "author": "['Andrew J.

This political biography of Paulo Freire (1921-97), who played a crucial role in shaping international literacy education, also presents a thoughtful examination of the volatile politics of literacy during the Cold War. A native of Brazil's impoverished northeast, Freire developed adult literacy training techniques that involved consciousness-raising, encouraging peasants and newly urban peoples to see themselves as active citizens who could transform their own lives. Freire's work for state and national government agencies in Brazil in the early 1960s eventually aroused the suspicion of the Brazilian military, as well as of U.S. government aid programs. Political pressures led to Freire's brief imprisonment, following the military coup of 1964, and then to more than a decade and a half in exile. During this period, Freire continued his work in Chile, Nicaragua, and postindependence African countries, as well as in Geneva with the World Council of Churches and in the United States at Harvard University.

A few celebrated figures in the Continental Congress do not make for a revolution. It requires tens of thousands of ordinary men and women willing to sacrifice, kill, and be killed. Breen not only gives the history of these ordinary Americans but, drawing upon a wealth of rarely seen documents, restores their primacy to American independence. Mobilizing two years before the Declaration of Independence, American insurgents in all thirteen colonies concluded that resistance to British oppression required organized violence against the state. They channeled popular rage through elected committees of safety and observation, which before 1776 were the heart of American resistance.

Owoman, woman! your example is powerful, your influence great.\"--Maria W. Stewart, \"An Address Delivered Before the Afric-American Female Intelligence Society of Boston\" (1832) Here--in the only collection of speeches by nineteenth-century African-American women--is the battle of words these brave women waged to address the social ills of their century. While there have been some scattered references to the unique roles these early \"race women\" played in effecting social change, until now few scholars have considered the rhetorical strategies they adopted to develop their powerful arguments. In this chronological anthology, Shirley Wilson Logan highlights the public addresses of these women, beginning with Maria W. Stewart's speech at Franklin Hall in 1832, believed to be the first delivered to an audience of men and women by an American-born woman. In her speech, she focused on the plight of the Northern free black. Sojourner Truth spoke in 1851 at the Akron, Ohio, Women's Rights Convention not only for the rights of black women but also for the rights of all oppressed nineteenth-century women. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper struggled with the conflict between universal suffrage and suffrage for black men. Anna Julia Cooper chastised her unique audience of black Episcopalian clergy for their failure to continue the tradition of the elevation of womanhood initiated by Christianity and especially for their failure to support the struggling Southern black woman. Ida B. Wells's rhetoric targeted mob violence directed at Southern black men. Her speech was delivered less than a year after her inaugural lecture on this issue--following a personal encounter with mob violence in Memphis. Fannie Barrier Williams and Victoria Earle Matthews advocated social and educational reforms to improve the plight of Southern black women. These speeches--all delivered between 1832 and 1895--are stirring proof that, despite obstacles of race and gender, these women still had the courage to mount the platform in defense of the oppressed. Introductory essays focus on each speaker's life and rhetoric, considering the ways in which these women selected evidence and adapted language to particular occasions, purposes, and audiences in order to persuade. This analysis of the rhetorical contexts and major rhetorical tactics in the speeches aids understanding of both the speeches and the skill of the speakers. A rhetorical timeline serves as a point of reference. Historically grounded, this book provides a black feminist perspective on significant events of the nineteenth century and reveals how black women of that era influenced and were influenced by the social problems they addressed. \"A government which can protect and defend its citizens from wrong and outrage and does not is vicious. A government which would do itand cannot is weak; and where human life is insecure through either weakness or viciousness in the administration of law, there must be a lack of justice, and where this is wanting nothing can make up the deficiency.\"--Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, \"Duty to Dependent Races,\" National Council of Women of the United States, Washington, D.C.

However, other, less familiar places, such as the palace of the so-called supreme chief of Vod\u00fan in B\u00e9nin, are also rising in popularity as tourists become increasingly adventurous and as more Vod\u00fan priests and temples make themselves available to foreigners in the hopes of earning extra money. Timothy R. Landry examines the connections between local Vod\u00fan priests and spiritual seekers who travel to B\u00e9nin\u2014some for the snapshot, others for full-fledged initiation into the religion. He argues that the ways in which the Vod\u00fan priests and tourists negotiate the transfer of confidential, sacred knowledge create its value. The more secrecy that surrounds Vod\u00fan ritual practice and material culture, the more authentic, coveted, and, consequently, expensive that knowledge becomes. Landry writes as anthropologist and initiate, having participated in hundreds of Vod\u00fan ceremonies, rituals, and festivals. Examining the role of money, the incarnation of deities, the limits of adaptation for the transnational community, and the belief in spirits, sorcery, and witchcraft, Vod\u00fan ponders the ethical implications of producing and consuming culture by local and international agents. Highlighting the ways in which racialization, power, and the legacy of colonialism affect the procurement and transmission of secret knowledge in West Africa and beyond, Landry demonstrates how, paradoxically, secrecy is critically important to Vod\u00fan's global expansion.", "page_count": 216, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["AAS3500-12"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8129-7178-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780812971781", "isbn10": "0812971787", "title": "Enrique's Journey: The Story Of A Boy's Dangerous Odyssey To Reunite With His Mother", "author": "['Sonia Nazario']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/81/9780812971781.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 18.0, "bookstore_used_price": 8.45, "publisher": "Random House Trade Paperbacks", "date": "2007", "description": "Based On The Los Angeles Times Series That Won Two Pulitzer Prizes, This Is A Timeless Story Of Families Torn Apart.

At The Time, Japan Was In Shambles, Its Imperial Dream Shattered, And Its People Reduced To Scrounging For Sufficient Food To Stay Alive. Yet Over The Past Half Century, Japan Has Remade Itself And Emerged As One Of The Leading Economic Powers In The World. How Did Japan Achieve This Success, And What Has This Remarkable Rebirth Meant For The Japanese People? In Eastern Phoenix, Mikiso Hane Closely Examines Historical Factors That Have Contributed To Japan's Postwar Development Politically, Economically, Socially, And Culturally. Beginning With The Occupation By U.s. Forces Under Gen. Douglas Macarthur, Hane Shows How American Reforms And Initiatives Combined With The Political Actions Of Subsequent Japanese Leaders To Create A Country Able To Forge Ahead Economically While Retaining Many Traditional Aspects Of Prewar Japanese Society. In Addition To Presenting A Narrative Overview Of Important Events Since 1945, Eastern Phoenix Provides Insight Into The Evolution Of Japan's Foreign Relations, Internal Effects Of Prosperity On Japanese Society, And Problems That Remain Despite Extraordinary Progress. The Book Critically Examines Such Media-hot Topics As Education, Environmental Degradation, Organized Crime, Racial And Class Discrimination, The Japanese Work Ethic, And The Role Of Women In Society. To Provide Useful Context For Student Readers, Hane Frequently Punctuates His Discussion By Contrasting Japanese Statistics With Those Of The United States. The Book Also Excels In Examining How Artists And Writers Have Grappled With Japan's Rapidly Evolving Contemporary History, And Hane Points The Reader Toward Books And Films That Can Shed Additional Light On Japanese Perceptions Of The Past Fifty Years.--publisher Description.

In this effort to restore Jefferson to his own world, Onuf reconnects that world to ours, providing a fresh look at the distinction between private and public aspects of his character that Jefferson himself took such pains to cultivate. Breaking through Jefferson\u2019s alleged opacity as a person by collapsing the contemporary interpretive frameworks often used to diagnose his psychological and moral states, Onuf raises new questions about what was on Jefferson\u2019s mind as he looked toward an uncertain future. Particularly striking is his argument that Jefferson\u2019s character as a moralist is nowhere more evident, ironically, than in his engagement with the institution of slavery.

Enslaved people first helped to construct and then later lived in the Academical Village; they raised and prepared food, washed clothes, cleaned privies, and chopped wood. They maintained the buildings, cleaned classrooms, and served as personal servants to faculty and students. At any given time, there were typically more than 100 enslaved people residing alongside the students, faculty, and their families. The central paradox at the heart of UVA is also that of the nation: What does it mean to have a public university founded to preserve democratic rights that is likewise founded and maintained on the stolen labor of others? In Educated in Tyranny, Maurie McInnis and Louis Nelson tell the largely unknown story of slavery at the University of Virginia. While the university has long been celebrated as fulfilling Jefferson's desire to educate citizens to lead and govern, McInnis and Nelson instead document the burgeoning political rift over slavery as Jefferson tried to protect southern men from anti-slavery ideas in northern institutions.

Based on four years of field work with both the adolescent members and staff of an inner-city youth organization in a large Midwestern city, Pride in the Projects examines the construction of identity as it occurs within this local context, emphasizing the relationships within which identities are formed.

A former gang member and juvenile delinquent, Rios managed to escape the bleak outcome of many of his friends and earned a PhD at Berkeley and returned to his hometown to study how inner city young Latino and African American boys develop their sense of self in the midst of crime and intense policing. Punished examines the difficult lives of these young men, who now face punitive policies in their schools, communities, and a world where they are constantly policed and stigmatized. Rios followed a group of forty delinquent Black and Latino boys for three years. These boys found themselves in a vicious cycle, caught in a spiral of punishment and incarceration as they were harassed, profiled, watched, and disciplined at young ages, even before they had committed any crimes, eventually leading many of them to fulfill the destiny expected of them. But beyond a fatalistic account of these marginalized young men, Rios finds that the very system that criminalizes them and limits their opportunities, sparks resistance and a raised consciousness that motivates some to transform their lives and become productive citizens. Ultimately, he argues that by understanding the lives of the young men who are criminalized and pipelined through the criminal justice system, we can begin to develop empathic solutions which support these young men in their development and to eliminate the culture of punishment that has become an overbearing part of their everyday lives.", "page_count": 237, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["SOC2230-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8147-9719-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780814797198", "isbn10": "0814797199", "title": "The Post-Soviet Wars: Rebellion, Ethnic Conflict, and Nationhood in the Caucasus", "author": "['Christoph Zurcher']", "req_type": "Optional", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JAChBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JAChBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 28.0, "bookstore_used_price": 0.0, "publisher": "NYU Press", "date": "2007-11-01", "description": "The Post-Soviet Wars is a comparative account of the organized violence in the Caucusus region, looking at four key areas: Chechnya, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Dagestan.

In Generation Unbound, Isabel V. Sawhill offers a third approach: change \"drifters\" into \"planners.\" In a well-written and accessible survey of the impact of family structure on child well-being, Sawhill contrasts \"planners,\" who are delaying parenthood until after they marry, with \"drifters,\" who are having unplanned children early and outside of marriage. These two distinct patterns are contributing to an emerging class divide and threatening social mobility in the United States. Sawhill draws on insights from the new field of behavioral economics, showing that it is possible, by changing the default, to move from a culture that accepts a high number of unplanned pregnancies to a culture in which adults only have children when they are ready to be a parent.", "page_count": 209, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["SOC4057-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8166-4918-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780816649181", "isbn10": "0816649189", "title": "How the Religious Right Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism", "author": "['Tina Fetner']", "req_type": "Attnd First", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3jhtwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3jhtwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 22.5, "bookstore_used_price": 16.79, "publisher": "", "date": "2008", "description": "While gay rights are on the national agenda now, activists have spent decades fighting for their platform, seeing themselves as David against the religious righta s Goliath.

Shiri Pasternak corrects this misconception, showing that colonialism is very much alive in Canada. From the perspective of Indigenous law and jurisdiction, she tells the story of the Algonquins of Barriere Lake, in western Quebec, and their tireless resistance to federal land claims policy. Grounded Authority chronicles the band's ongoing attempts to restore full governance over its lands and natural resources through an agreement signed by settler governments almost three decades ago--an agreement the state refuses to fully implement. Pasternak argues that the state's aversion to recognizing Algonquin jurisdiction stems from its goal of perfecting its sovereignty by replacing the inherent jurisdiction of Indigenous peoples with its own, delegated authority. From police brutality and fabricated sexual abuse cases to an intervention into and overthrow of a customary government, Pasternak provides a compelling, richly detailed account of rarely documented coercive mechanisms employed to force Indigenous communities into compliance with federal policy. A rigorous account of the incredible struggle fought by the Algonquins to maintain responsibility over their territory, Grounded Authority provides a powerful alternative model to one nation's land claims policy and a vital contribution to current debates in the study of colonialism and Indigenous peoples in North America and globally.", "page_count": 392, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLCP4500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8195-7166-3", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780819571663", "isbn10": "0819571660", "title": "Practical Water", "author": "['Brenda Hillman']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Eq8TKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Eq8TKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 15.95, "bookstore_used_price": 11.91, "publisher": "", "date": "2011-08-01", "description": "The latest volume in Hillman's acclaimed meditations on the elements", "page_count": 103, "google_rating": 3.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["ENGL8596-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8195-7806-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780819578068", "isbn10": "0819578061", "title": "Animal Musicalities: Birds, Beasts, And Evolutionary Listening (music / Culture)", "author": "['Rachel Mundy']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/68/9780819578068.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 29.95, "bookstore_used_price": 22.45, "publisher": "Wesleyan University Press", "date": "2018", "description": "", "page_count": 264, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELG5559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8222-0953-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780822209539", "isbn10": "0822209535", "title": "The Rimers of Eldritch: A Play in Two Acts", "author": "['Lanford Wilson']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f6vrQyPxA0oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f6vrQyPxA0oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 10.0, "bookstore_used_price": 4.99, "publisher": "Dramatists Play Service, Inc.", "date": "1967-01-01", "description": "THE STORY: As Martin Gottfried comments, It is a simple one.

Lowe discusses the contradictions whereby Asians have been included in the workplaces and markets of the U.S. nation-state, yet, through exclusion laws and bars from citizenship, have been distanced from the terrain of national culture. Lowe argues that a national memory haunts the conception of Asian American, persisting beyond the repeal of individual laws and sustained by U.S. wars in Asia, in which the Asian is seen as the perpetual immigrant, as the \u201cforeigner-within.\u201d In Immigrant Acts, she argues that rather than attesting to the absorption of cultural difference into the universality of the national political sphere, the Asian immigrant\u2014at odds with the cultural, racial, and linguistic forms of the nation\u2014displaces the temporality of assimilation. Distance from the American national culture constitutes Asian American culture as an alternative site that produces cultural forms materially and aesthetically in contradiction with the institutions of citizenship and national identity. Rather than a sign of a \u201cfailed\u201d integration of Asians into the American cultural sphere, this critique preserves and opens up different possibilities for political practice and coalition across racial and national borders. In this uniquely interdisciplinary study, Lowe examines the historical, political, cultural, and aesthetic meanings of immigration in relation to Asian Americans.

The \"Korean Wave\" of music, film, television, sports, and cuisine generates significant revenues and cultural pride in South Korea. The Korean Popular Culture Reader provides a timely and essential foundation for the study of \"K-pop,\" relating the contemporary cultural landscape to its historical roots. The essays in this collection reveal the intimate connections of Korean popular culture, or hallyu, to the peninsula's colonial and postcolonial histories, to the nationalist projects of the military dictatorship, and to the neoliberalism of twenty-first-century South Korea. Combining translations of seminal essays by Korean scholars on topics ranging from sports to colonial-era serial fiction with new work by scholars based in fields including literary studies, film and media studies, ethnomusicology, and art history, this collection expertly navigates the social and political dynamics that have shaped Korean cultural production over the past century.

Melinda Cooper and Catherine Waldby take on that project, analyzing what they call \"clinical labor,\" and asking what such an analysis might indicate about the organization of the bioeconomy and the broader organization of labor and value today. At the same time, they reflect on the challenges that clinical labor might pose to some of the founding assumptions of classical, Marxist, and post-Fordist theories of labor. Cooper and Waldby examine the rapidly expanding transnational labor markets surrounding assisted reproduction and experimental drug trials. As they discuss, the pharmaceutical industry demands ever greater numbers of trial subjects to meet its innovation imperatives. The assisted reproductive market grows as more and more households look to third-party providers for fertility services and sectors of the biomedical industry seek reproductive tissues rich in stem cells. Cooper and Waldby trace the historical conditions, political economy, and contemporary trajectory of clinical labor. Ultimately, they reveal clinical labor to be emblematic of labor in twenty-first-century neoliberal economies.", "page_count": 279, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ANTH3290-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8223-5807-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780822358077", "isbn10": "0822358077", "title": "Shine: The Visual Economy Of Light In African Diasporic Aesthetic Practice", "author": "['Krista A.

Eidsheim examines singers Marian Anderson, Billie Holiday, and Jimmy Scott as well as the vocal synthesis technology Vocaloid to show how listeners carry a series of assumptions about the nature of the voice and who it belongs to. Outlining how the voice is linked to ideas of racial essentialism and authenticity, Eidsheim untangles the relationship between race, gender, vocal technique, and timbre while addressing an undertheorized space of racial and ethnic performance. In so doing, she advances our knowledge of the cultural-historical formation of the timbral politics of difference and the ways that comprehending voice remains central to understanding human experience, all the while advocating for a form of listening that would allow us to hear singers in a self-reflexive, denaturalized way.", "page_count": 304, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELG5559-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-0-8223-6918-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9780822369189", "isbn10": "0822369184", "title": "The Right to Maim: Debility, Capacity, Disability", "author": "['Jasbir K.

How would our understanding of this seminal event change if we read Japanese and Euro-American texts together and across disciplines? In Producing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Yuko Shibata juxtaposes literary and cinematic texts usually considered separately to highlight the \u201cconnected divides\u201d in the production of knowledge on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, shedding new light on both texts and contexts in the process. Shibata takes up two canonical works\u2014American journalist John Hersey\u2019s account, Hiroshima, and French director Alain Resnais\u2019 avant-garde film, Hiroshima Mon Amour\u2014that are traditionally excluded from study in Japanese literature and cinema. By examining Hersey\u2019s Hiroshima in conjunction with The Bells of Nagasaki (Nagai Takashi) and Children of the A-Bomb (Osada Arata), both Japanese bestsellers, Shibata demonstrates how influential Hersey\u2019s Hiroshima has been in forging the normative narrative of the hibakusha experience in Japan. She also compares Hiroshima Mon Amour with Kamei Fumio\u2019s documentary, Still It\u2019s Good to Live, whose footage Resnais borrowed to depict atomic bomb victimhood. Resnais\u2019 avant-garde masterpiece, she contends, is the palimpsest of Kamei\u2019s surrealist documentary; both blur the binaries between realist and avant-garde representations. Reading Hiroshima Mon Amour in its historical context enables Shibata to offer an entirely new analysis of Renais\u2019 work.

Apache conceptions of wisdom, manners and morals, and of their own history are inextricably intertwined with place, and by allowing us to overhear his conversations with Apaches on these subjects Basso expands our awareness of what place can mean to people. Most of us use the termsense of placeoften and rather carelessly when we think of nature or home or literature. Our senses of place, however, come not only from our individual experiences but also from our cultures.Wisdom Sits in Places, the first sustained study of places and place-names by an anthropologist, explores place, places, and what they mean to a particular group of people, the Western Apache in Arizona. For more than thirty years, Keith Basso has been doing fieldwork among the Western Apache, and now he shares with us what he has learned of Apache place-names--where they come from and what they mean to Apaches. \"This is indeed a brilliant exposition of landscape and language in the world of the Western Apache. But it is more than that. Keith Basso gives us to understand something about the sacred and indivisible nature of words and place. And this is a universal equation, a balance in the universe. Place may be the first of all concepts; it may be the oldest of all words.\"--N.

Yet, increased inequality in America has made that dream more difficult for many to obtain. In Too Many Children Left Behind, an international team of social scientists assesses how social mobility varies in the United States compared with Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Bruce Bradbury, Miles Corak, Jane Waldfogel, and Elizabeth Washbrook show that the academic achievement gap between disadvantaged American children and their more advantaged peers is far greater than in other wealthy countries, with serious consequences for their future life outcomes. With education the key to expanding opportunities for those born into low socioeconomic status families, Too Many Children Left Behind helps us better understand educational disparities and how to reduce them. Analyzing data on 8,000 school children in the United States, the authors demonstrate that disadvantages that begin early in life have long-lasting effects on academic performance. The social inequalities that children experience before they start school contribute to a large gap in test scores between low- and high-SES students later in life. Many children from low-SES backgrounds lack critical resources, including books, high-quality child care, and other goods and services that foster the stimulating environment necessary for cognitive development. The authors find that not only is a child\u2019s academic success deeply tied to his or her family background, but that this class-based achievement gap does not narrow as the child proceeds through school. The authors compare test score gaps from the United States with those from three other countries and find smaller achievement gaps and greater social mobility in all three, particularly in Canada. The wider availability of public resources for disadvantaged children in those countries facilitates the early child development that is fundamental for academic success.

Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5\u00ae easier to use across all settings: The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations. The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders). Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations.

Now comes an updated version that expands the narrative account and adds new perspective from author Peter Baker, Chief White House Correspondent for The New York Times. In this new edition, Baker reports on new details about the final months of the Obama presidency as Russia sought to intervene in American democracy, and assesses the impact of Donald Trump's presidency on Barack Obama's legacy. Baker chronicles a period of great hope, tumult, accomplishments, and, yes, failure. This is the story of a young president who took on the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression, forged a controversial health care program, watched anxiously in the Situation Room after approving the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden and endured mid-term election defeats. In a presidency buffeted by one crisis after another, he struggled with the Syrian civil war, a Russian invasion of its neighbor, the rise of the Islamic State, and, at home, often violent racial strife and recalcitrant Congress. \"His first line in the history books was written the day he won office as the first African-American president, but he was determined to offer more than simply a new complexion in the Oval Office,\" writes Baker, Chief White House Correspondent for The New York Times, about the 44th president of the United States. Inspiring in a crowded stadium yet difficult behind the scenes, Obama was a master politician who loathed politics. To many, he was an enigma, often seen through the lens of the observer--a liberal zealot to the right, an overeager compromiser to the left. \"I am a Rorschach test,\" he once noted. But he was the dominant figure of his age. After eight eventful years, he would never be the same--and neither would be his country.

Drawing on archival documents, ethnographic observation, comparative political theory, and an original survey, Islam and Democracy in Indonesia demonstrates that Indonesia's Muslim leaders favor a democracy in which individual rights and group-differentiated rights converge within a system of legal pluralism, a vision at odds with American-style secular government but common in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.", "page_count": 224, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLPT8500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-107-56644-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781107566446", "isbn10": "1107566444", "title": "The Paradox of Traditional Chiefs in Democratic Africa", "author": "['Kate Baldwin']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CDeFrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CDeFrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 34.99, "bookstore_used_price": 24.75, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "date": "2015-11-12", "description": "The Paradox of Traditional Chiefs in Democratic Africa shows that unelected traditional leaders can facilitate democratic responsiveness. Ironically, chiefs' undemocratic character gives them a capacity to organize responses to rural problems that elected politicians and state institutions lack. Specifically, chiefs' longer time horizons encourage investment in local institutions that enable the provision of local public goods. This is the paradox of traditional chiefs in democratic Africa: elected politicians can only effectively respond to rural constituents through institutions constructed and maintained by local leaders who are not worried about electoral terms. Furthermore, the critical role played by chiefs in brokering local development projects forces us to reassess how we understand the basis of their political influence during elections.

Individuals from all over the world and all walks of life share numerous practices, habits, and narratives when they serve as interveners in conflict zones. These common attitudes and actions enable foreign peacebuilders to function in the field, but they also result in unintended consequences that thwart international efforts.

Where past research on whites' racial attitudes emphasized out-group hostility, Jardina brings into focus the significance of in-group identity and favoritism.

With $155 billion in sales and 200,000 employees, GM is widely considered to be a proxy for the U.S. economy, making Barra's position arguably the most important corporate role a woman has ever held. This book describes the personal character, choices, and leadership style that enabled her to break through the glass ceiling. When 52-year-old Mary Barra was named CEO of General Motors in 2013, only people outside of the company were surprised. She had done everything from working on the factory floor to overseeing manufacturing, from improving union relations to paring down bureaucracy, and from running human resources to helping drag the company back from its 2009 bankruptcy. This book details each step of her career, and the lessons she learned along the way.

It first looks at the national initiative for quality and safety and links it to its origins in the IOM report. The second section defines each of the six QSEN competencies as well as providing teaching and clinical application strategies, resources, and current references. The final section now features redesigned chapters on implementing quality and safety across settings. New additions to this edition include: Instructional and practice approaches including narrative pedagogy and integrating the competencies in simulation A new chapter exploring the application of clinical learning and the critical nature of inter-professional teamwork A revised chapter on the mirror of education and practice to better understand teaching approaches This groundbreaking unique text addresses the challenges of preparing future nurses with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) necessary to continuously improve the health care system in which they practice.

Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers.

Is it wrong to buy the products of this industry?

The issues they cover include: how intelligence affects the badness of pain, whether consumers are responsible for the practices of an industry, how individual choices affect an industry, whether farm animals are better off living on factory farms than not existing at all, whether meat-eating is natural, whether morality protects those who cannot understand morality, whether morality protects those who are not members of society, whether humans alone possess souls, whether different creatures have different degrees of consciousness, why extreme animal welfare positions \"sound crazy,\" and the role of empathy in moral judgment. The two students go on to discuss the vegan life, why people who accept the arguments in favor of veganism often fail to change their behavior, and how vegans should interact with non-vegans. A foreword, by Peter Singer, introduces and provides context for the dialogues, and a final annotated bibliography offers a list of sources related to the discussion. It offers abstracts of the most important books and articles related to the ethics of vegetarianism and veganism. Key Features: Thoroughly reviews the common arguments on both sides of the debate.

When asked simple questions about global trends\u2014what percentage of the world\u2019s population live in poverty; why the world\u2019s population is increasing; how many girls finish school\u2014we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective\u2014from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse). Our problem is that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.

Part II explores how historical patterns of inclusion and exclusion have established the realities of racial and ethnic inequality today. Part III examines belief and ideology, including racial stereotypes, prejudice, forms of racism, and how they are influenced by popular culture. Part IV includes articles on racial identity and how race plays out in everyday life. Part V looks at the overlapping systems of race, class, and gender inequality. Part VI examines patterns of racial inequality in five major institutions: work, families and communities, housing and education, health care, and criminal justice.

Students generally come to this course with little knowledge or understanding of the importance of transportation, much less of the extensive career opportunities within the field. Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers.

They deny to pollsters, party activists, friends, and even themselves, their true partisanship, instead choosing to go 'undercover' as independents. Independent Politics demonstrates that people intentionally mask their partisan preferences in social situations.

If you think this is cause for celebration, you are not alone. Within the academic community (and not only among students of international cooperation), the notion that political institutions are mutually beneficial--that they would never come into existence, much less grow in size and assertiveness, were they not \"Pareto-improving\"--is today's conventional wisdom. But is it true? In this richly detailed and strikingly original study, Lloyd Gruber suggests that this emphasis on cooperation's positive-sum consequences may be leading scholars of international relations down the wrong theoretical path. The fact that membership in a cooperative arrangement is voluntary, Gruber argues, does not mean that it works to everyone's advantage. To the contrary, some cooperators may incur substantial losses relative to the original, non-cooperative status quo. So what, then, keeps these participants from withdrawing? Gruber's answer, in a word, is power--specifically the \"go-it-alone power\" exercised by the regime's beneficiaries, many of whom would continue to benefit even if their partners, the losers, were to opt out. To lend support to this thesis, Gruber takes a fresh look at the political origins and structures of European Monetary Unification and NAFTA. But the theoretical arguments elaborated in Ruling the World extend well beyond money and trade, touching upon issues of long-standing interest to students of security cooperation, environmental politics, nation-building--even political philosophy. Bold and compelling, this book will appeal to anyone interested in understanding how \"power politics\" really operates and why, for better or worse, it is fueling much of the supranational activity we see today.", "page_count": 336, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLIR8639-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4008-2873-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781400828739", "isbn10": "1400828732", "title": "Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers", "author": "['Karl Johan Astr\u00f6m', 'Richard M.

Unlike most books on the subject, Feedback Systems develops transfer functions through the exponential response of a system, and is accessible across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl \u00c5str\u00f6m and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. \u00c5str\u00f6m and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness.

Robert Gibbons addresses scholars in applied fields within economics who want a serious and thorough discussion of game theory but who may have found other works overly abstract. Gibbons emphasizes the economic applications of the theory at least as much as the pure theory itself; formal arguments about abstract games play a minor role. The applications illustrate the process of model building--of translating an informal description of a multi-person decision situation into a formal game-theoretic problem to be analyzed. Also, the variety of applications shows that similar issues arise in different areas of economics, and that the same game-theoretic tools can be applied in each setting. In order to emphasize the broad potential scope of the theory, conventional applications from industrial organization have been largely replaced by applications from labor, macro, and other applied fields in economics. The book covers four classes of games, and four corresponding notions of equilibrium: static games of complete information and Nash equilibrium, dynamic games of complete information and subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, static games of incomplete information and Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and dynamic games of incomplete information and perfect Bayesian equilibrium.", "page_count": 288, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ECON8010-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4008-3854-7", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781400838547", "isbn10": "1400838541", "title": "Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose, Second Edition", "author": "['Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas', 'Mark Turner']", "req_type": "Optional", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GOYq2EX1QuYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GOYq2EX1QuYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 27.02, "bookstore_used_price": 0.0, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "date": "2011-02-28", "description": "For more than a decade, Clear and Simple as the Truth has guided readers to consider style not as an elegant accessory of effective prose but as its very heart. Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas and Mark Turner present writing as an intellectual activity, not a passive application of verbal skills. In classic style, the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader and writer are intellectual equals, and the occasion is informal. This general style of presentation is at home everywhere, from business memos to personal letters and from magazine articles to student essays. Everyone talks about style, but no one explains it. The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart. At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards. The book is divided into four parts.

It critically analyzes basic concepts underlying most theories of justice, including impartiality, formal equality, and the unitary moral subjectivity. The starting point for her critique is the experience and concerns of the new social movements about decision making, cultural expression, and division of labor--that were created by marginal and excluded groups, including women, African Americans, and American Indians, as well as gays and lesbians. Iris Young defines concepts of domination and oppression to cover issues eluding the distributive model. Democratic theorists, according to Young do not adequately address the problem of an inclusive participatory framework. By assuming a homogeneous public, they fail to consider institutional arrangements for including people not culturally identified with white European male norms of reason and respectability. Young urges that normative theory and public policy should undermine group-based oppression by affirming rather than suppressing social group difference. Basing her vision of the good society on the differentiated, culturally plural network of contemporary urban life, she argues for a principle of group representation in democratic publics and for group-differentiated policies. Danielle Allen's new foreword contextualizes Young's work and explains how debates surrounding social justice have changed since--and been transformed by--the original publication of Justice and the Politics of Difference.", "page_count": 304, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PHIL3500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4008-4005-2", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781400840052", "isbn10": "1400840058", "title": "Between Citizens and the State: The Politics of American Higher Education in the 20th Century", "author": "['Christopher P.

Using cutting-edge analysis, Christopher Loss recovers higher education's central importance to the larger social and political history of the United States in the twentieth century, and chronicles its transformation into a key mediating institution between citizens and the state. Framed around the three major federal higher education policies of the twentieth century--the 1944 GI Bill, the 1958 National Defense Education Act, and the 1965 Higher Education Act--the book charts the federal government's various efforts to deploy education to ready citizens for the national, bureaucratized, and increasingly global world in which they lived. Loss details the myriad ways in which academic leaders and students shaped, and were shaped by, the state's shifting political agenda as it moved from a preoccupation with economic security during the Great Depression, to national security during World War II and the Cold War, to securing the rights of African Americans, women, and other previously marginalized groups during the 1960s and '70s. Along the way, Loss reappraises the origins of higher education's current-day diversity regime, the growth of identity group politics, and the privatization of citizenship at the close of the twentieth century. At a time when people's faith in government and higher education is being sorely tested, this book sheds new light on the close relations between American higher education and politics.", "page_count": 344, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["EDLF7602-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4008-4035-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781400840359", "isbn10": "140084035X", "title": "Why Americans Hate the Media and How It Matters", "author": "['Jonathan M.

Yet by the 1990s, this trust had all but evaporated. Why has confidence in the press declined so dramatically over the past 40 years? And has this change shaped the public's political behavior? This book examines waning public trust in the institutional news media within the context of the American political system and looks at how this lack of confidence has altered the ways people acquire political information and form electoral preferences. Jonathan Ladd argues that in the 1950s, '60s, and early '70s, competition in American party politics and the media industry reached historic lows. When competition later intensified in both of these realms, the public's distrust of the institutional media grew, leading the public to resist the mainstream press's information about policy outcomes and turn toward alternative partisan media outlets. As a result, public beliefs and voting behavior are now increasingly shaped by partisan predispositions. Ladd contends that it is not realistic or desirable to suppress party and media competition to the levels of the mid-twentieth century; rather, in the contemporary media environment, new ways to augment the public's knowledgeability and responsiveness must be explored. Drawing on historical evidence, experiments, and public opinion surveys, this book shows that in a world of endless news sources, citizens' trust in institutional media is more important than ever before.", "page_count": 288, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["PLAP3140-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4008-4073-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781400840731", "isbn10": "1400840732", "title": "The Dark Sides of Virtue: Reassessing International Humanitarianism", "author": "['David Kennedy']", "req_type": "Optional", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-gPafk1ydBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-gPafk1ydBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 37.5, "bookstore_used_price": 0.0, "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "date": "2011-06-27", "description": "In this provocative and timely book, David Kennedy explores what can go awry when we put our humanitarian yearnings into action on a global scale--and what we can do in response. Rooted in Kennedy's own experience in numerous humanitarian efforts, the book examines campaigns for human rights, refugee protection, economic development, and for humanitarian limits to the conduct of war. It takes us from the jails of Uruguay to the corridors of the United Nations, from the founding of a non-governmental organization dedicated to the liberation of East Timor to work aboard an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. Kennedy shares the satisfactions of international humanitarian engagement--but also the disappointments of a faith betrayed. With humanitarianism's new power comes knowledge that even the most well-intentioned projects can create as many problems as they solve. Kennedy develops a checklist of the unforeseen consequences, blind spots, and biases of humanitarian work--from focusing too much on rules and too little on results to the ambiguities of waging war in the name of human rights. He explores the mix of altruism, self-doubt, self-congratulation, and simple disorientation that accompany efforts to bring humanitarian commitments to foreign settings. Writing for all those who wish that \"globalization\" could be more humane, Kennedy urges us to think and work more pragmatically.

It is a question bound up with others--about freedom of speech, terror, violence, human rights, women's dress, and sexuality. Above all, it is tied to the possibility of democracy. In this fearless, original, and surprising book, Anne Norton demolishes the notion that there is a \"clash of civilizations\" between the West and Islam. What is really in question, she argues, is the West's commitment to its own ideals: to democracy and the Enlightenment trinity of liberty, equality, and fraternity. In the most fundamental sense, the Muslim question is about the values not of Islamic, but of Western, civilization. Moving between the United States and Europe, Norton provides a fresh perspective on iconic controversies, from the Danish cartoon of Muhammad to the murder of Theo van Gogh. She examines the arguments of a wide range of thinkers--from John Rawls to Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. And she describes vivid everyday examples of ordinary Muslims and non-Muslims who have accepted each other and built a common life together. Ultimately, Norton provides a new vision of a richer and more diverse democratic life in the West, one that makes room for Muslims rather than scapegoating them for the West's own anxieties.", "page_count": 288, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["PLPT8500-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4008-5121-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781400851218", "isbn10": "1400851211", "title": "The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit", "author": "['Thomas J.

They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us\u2014it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But Jason Brennan says they are all wrong. In this trenchant book, Brennan argues that democracy should be judged by its results\u2014and the results are not good enough. Just as defendants have a right to a fair trial, citizens have a right to competent government. But democracy is the rule of the ignorant and the irrational, and it all too often falls short. Furthermore, no one has a fundamental right to any share of political power, and exercising political power does most of us little good. On the contrary, a wide range of social science research shows that political participation and democratic deliberation actually tend to make people worse\u2014more irrational, biased, and mean. Given this grim picture, Brennan argues that a new system of government\u2014epistocracy, the rule of the knowledgeable\u2014may be better than democracy, and that it's time to experiment and find out.

In Censored, Margaret Roberts demonstrates that even censorship that is easy to circumvent can still be enormously effective. Taking advantage of digital data harvested from the Chinese Internet and leaks from China's Propaganda Department, this important book sheds light on how and when censorship influences the Chinese public. Roberts finds that much of censorship in China works not by making information impossible to access but by requiring those seeking information to spend extra time and money for access. By inconveniencing users, censorship diverts the attention of citizens and powerfully shapes the spread of information. When Internet users notice blatant censorship, they are willing to compensate for better access. But subtler censorship, such as burying search results or introducing distracting information on the web, is more effective because users are less aware of it. Roberts challenges the conventional wisdom that online censorship is undermined when it is incomplete and shows instead how censorship's porous nature is used strategically to divide the public. Drawing parallels between censorship in China and the way information is manipulated in the United States and other democracies, Roberts reveals how Internet users are susceptible to control even in the most open societies.

What's so great about them? Why should you design and use essential questions in your classroom? Essential questions (EQs) help target standards as you organize curriculum content into coherent units that yield focused and thoughtful learning. In the classroom, EQs are used to stimulate students' discussions and promote a deeper understanding of the content. Whether you are an Understanding by Design (UbD) devotee or are searching for ways to address standards--local or Common Core State Standards--in an engaging way, Jay McTighe and Grant Wiggins provide practical guidance on how to design, initiate, and embed inquiry-based teaching and learning in your classroom. Offering dozens of examples, the authors explore the usefulness of EQs in all K-12 content areas, including skill-based areas such as math, PE, language instruction, and arts education. As an important element of their backward design approach to designing curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the authors *Give a comprehensive explanation of why EQs are so important; *Explore seven defining characteristics of EQs; *Distinguish between topical and overarching questions and their uses; *Outline the rationale for using EQs as the focal point in creating units of study; and *Show how to create effective EQs, working from sources including standards, desired understandings, and student misconceptions. Using essential questions can be challenging--for both teachers and students--and this book provides guidance through practical and proven processes, as well as suggested \"response strategies\" to encourage student engagement. Finally, you will learn how to create a culture of inquiry so that all members of the educational community--students, teachers, and administrators--benefit from the increased rigor and deepened understanding that emerge when essential questions become a guiding force for learners of all ages.", "page_count": 119, "google_rating": 5.0, "num_reviews": 1, "class_objects": ["EDIS8800-500"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4166-1773-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781416617730", "isbn10": "1416617736", "title": "Assessment and Student Success in a Differentiated Classroom", "author": "['Carol A.

Readers learn how differentiation can --Capture student interest and increase motivation --Clarify teachers' understanding about what is most important to teach --Enhance students' and teachers' belief in student learning capacity; and --Help teachers understand their students' individual similarities and differences so they can reach more students, more effectively Throughout, Tomlinson and Moon emphasize the importance of maintaining a consistent focus on the essential knowledge, understandings, and skills that all students must acquire, no matter what their starting point. Detailed scenarios illustrate how assessment differentiation can occur in three realms (student readiness, interest, and learning style or preference) and how it can improve assessment validity and reliability and decrease errors and teacher bias.

How were troops able to defend the Empire\u2019s vast territories from constant attacks? And how did they do so at such moderate cost that their treasury could pay for an immensity of highways, aqueducts, amphitheaters, city baths, and magnificent temples? In The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, seasoned defense analyst Edward N.

Rome\u2019s secret was not ceaseless fighting, but comprehensive strategies that unified force, diplomacy, and an immense infrastructure of roads, forts, walls, and barriers. Initially relying on client states to buffer attacks, Rome moved to a permanent frontier defense around 117 CE. Finally, as barbarians began to penetrate the empire, Rome filed large armies in a strategy of \"defense-in-depth,\" allowing invaders to pierce Rome\u2019s borders.

More often than not, Wenger demonstrates, religious freedom talk worked to privilege the dominant white Christian population. At the same time, a diverse array of minority groups at home and colonized people abroad invoked and reinterpreted this ideal to defend themselves and their ways of life. In so doing they posed sharp challenges to the racial and religious exclusions of American life. People of almost every religious stripe have argued, debated, negotiated, and brought into being an ideal called American religious freedom, subtly transforming their own identities and traditions in the process.

The organization of the book interweaves the three components in the subtitle, with each building on and supporting the others. Techniques include not just computational methods for producing solutions to differential equations, but also qualitative methods for extracting conceptual information about differential equations and the systems modeled by them. Theory is developed as a means of organizing, understanding, and codifying general principles. Applications show the usefulness of the subject as a whole and heighten interest in both solution techniques and theory. Formal proofs are included in cases where they enhance core understanding; otherwise, they are replaced by informal justifications containing key ideas of a proof in a more conversational format. Applications are drawn from a wide variety of fields: those in physical science and engineering are prominent, of course, but models from biology, medicine, ecology, economics, and sports are also featured. The 1,400+ exercises are especially compelling. They range from routine calculations to large-scale projects. The more difficult problems, both theoretical and applied, are typically presented in manageable steps. The hundreds of meticulously detailed modeling problems were deliberately designed along pedagogical principles found especially effective in the MAA study Characteristics of Successful Calculus Programs, namely, that asking students to work problems that require them to grapple with concepts (or even proofs) and do modeling activities is key to successful student experiences and retention in STEM programs. The exposition itself is exceptionally readable, rigorous yet conversational. Students will find it inviting and approachable.

Central to the very idea of America is the principle that we are a nation of opportunity. But over the last quarter century we have seen a disturbing \u201copportunity gap\u201d emerge. We Americans have always believed that those who have talent and try hard will succeed, but this central tenet of the American Dream seems no longer true or at the least, much less true than it was. In Our Kids, Robert Putnam offers a personal and authoritative look at this new American crisis, beginning with the example of his high school class of 1959 in Port Clinton, Ohio. The vast majority of those students went on to lives better than those of their parents. But their children and grandchildren have faced diminishing prospects.

Many Cine de Oro (Golden Age cinema) films adhered to the dominant Hollywood model, but a small yet formidable filmmaking faction rejected Hollywood\u2019s paradigm outright. Directors Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Juan Bustillo Oro, Adolfo Best Maugard, and Julio Bracho sought to create a unique national cinema that, through the stories it told and the ways it told them, was wholly Mexican. The Classical Mexican Cinema traces the emergence and evolution of this Mexican cinematic aesthetic, a distinctive film form designed to express lo mexicano. Charles Ram\u00edrez Berg begins by locating the classical style\u2019s pre-cinematic roots in the work of popular Mexican artist Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada at the turn of the twentieth century. He also looks at the dawning of Mexican classicism in the poetics of Enrique Rosas\u2019 El Autom\u00f3vil Gris, the crowning achievement of Mexico\u2019s silent filmmaking era and the film that set the stage for the Golden Age films. Berg then analyzes mature examples of classical Mexican filmmaking by the predominant Golden Age auteurs of three successive decades. Drawing on neoformalism and neoauteurism within a cultural studies framework, he brilliantly reveals how the poetics of Classical Mexican Cinema deviated from the formal norms of the Golden Age to express a uniquely Mexican sensibility thematically, stylistically, and ideologically.", "page_count": 254, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["MDST3584-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-4773-0877-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781477308776", "isbn10": "1477308776", "title": "Beyond Machismo: Intersectional Latino Masculinities", "author": "['A\u00edda Hurtado', 'Mrinal  Sinha']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7YV5CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7YV5CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 29.95, "bookstore_used_price": 22.5, "publisher": "University of Texas Press", "date": "2016-03-29", "description": "Long considered a pervasive value of Latino cultures both south and north of the US border, machismo\u2014a hypermasculinity that obliterates any other possible influences on men\u2019s attitudes and behavior\u2014is still used to define Latino men and boys in the larger social narrative. Yet a closer look reveals young, educated Latino men who are going beyond machismo to a deeper understanding of women\u2019s experiences and a commitment to ending gender oppression. This new Latino manhood is the subject of Beyond Machismo. Applying and expanding the concept of intersectionality developed by Chicana feminists, A\u00edda Hurtado and Mrinal Sinha explain how the influences of race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender shape Latinos\u2019 views of manhood, masculinity, and gender issues in Latino communities and their acceptance or rejection of feminism. In particular, the authors show how encountering Chicana feminist writings in college, as well as witnessing the horrors of sexist oppression in the United States and Latin America, propels young Latino men to a feminist consciousness.

Although Russia is the most prominent anti-gay regime in the region, LGBT individuals in other post-communist countries also suffer from discriminatory laws and prejudiced social institutions. Combining an historical overview with interviews and case studies in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, Conor O\u2019Dwyer analyzes the development and impact of LGBT movements in post-communist Eastern and Central Europe. O\u2019Dwyer argues that backlash against LGBT individuals has had the paradoxical effect of encouraging stronger and more organized activism, significantly impacting the social movement landscape in the region. As these peripheral Eastern and Central European countries vie for inclusion or at least recognition in the increasingly LGBT-friendly European Union, activist groups and organizations have become even more emboldened to push for change. Using fieldwork in five countries and interviews with activists, organizers, and public officials, O\u2019Dwyer explores the intricacies of these LGBT social movements and their structures, functions, and impact. The book provides a unique and engaging exploration of LGBT rights groups in Eastern and Central Europe and their ability to serve as models for future movements attempting to resist backlash.

The Life and Death of Latisha King examines a single incident, the shooting of 15-year-old Latisha King by 14-year-old Brian McInerney in their junior high school classroom in Oxnard, California in 2008. The press coverage of the shooting, as well as the criminal trial that followed, referred to Latisha, assigned male at birth, as Larry. Unpacking the consequences of representing the victim as Larry, a gay boy, instead of Latisha, a trans girl, Gayle Salamon draws on the resources of feminist phenomenology to analyze what happened in the school and at the trial that followed. In building on the phenomenological concepts of anonymity and comportment, Salamon considers how gender functions in the social world and the dangers of being denied anonymity as both a particularizing and dehumanizing act. Salamon offers close readings of the court transcript and the bodily gestures of the participants in the courtroom to illuminate the ways gender and race were both evoked in and expunged from the narrative of the killing. Across court documents and media coverage, Salamon sheds light on the relation between the speakable and unspeakable in the workings of the transphobic imaginary.

Heavy is a \u201cgorgeous, gutting\u2026generous\u201d (The New York Times) memoir that combines personal stories with piercing intellect to reflect both on the strife of American society and on Laymon\u2019s experiences with abuse. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, he asks us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free. \u201cA book for people who appreciated Roxane Gay\u2019s memoir Hunger\u201d (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel), Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family through years of haunting implosions and long reverberations. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to put [this memoir] down\u2026It is packed with reminders of how black dreams get skewed and deferred, yet are also pregnant with the possibility that a kind of redemption may lie in intimate grappling with black realities\u201d (The Atlantic).", "page_count": 256, "google_rating": 4.0, "num_reviews": 11, "class_objects": ["ENCW2200-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-5011-2762-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781501127625", "isbn10": "1501127624", "title": "Steve Jobs", "author": "['Walter Isaacson']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JT6FCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JT6FCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 13.75, "bookstore_used_price": 10.35, "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "date": "2015-09-15", "description": "Walter Isaacson\u2019s \u201centhralling\u201d (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs\u2014the inspiration for the movie Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years\u2014as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues\u2014Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson\u2019s portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.

Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson \u201cdeftly reveals an intimate Leonardo\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle) in a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo\u2019s genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. He explored the math of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced illusions of changing perspectives in The Last Supper. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history\u2019s most creative genius. In the \u201cluminous\u201d (Daily Beast) Leonardo da Vinci, Isaacson describes how Leonardo\u2019s delight at combining diverse passions remains the ultimate recipe for creativity. So, too, does his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. His life should remind us of the importance to be imaginative and, like talented rebels in any era, to think different.

Editor Michael Scammell and translator Philip Boehm bring us a brilliant novel, a remarkable discovery, and a new translation of an international classic. In print continually since 1940, Darkness at Noon has been translated into over 30 languages and is both a stirring novel and a classic anti-fascist text. What makes its popularity and tenacity even more remarkable is that all existing versions of Darkness at Noon are based on a hastily made English translation of the original German by a novice translator at the outbreak of World War II. In 2015, Matthias We\u00dfel stumbled across an entry in the archives of the Zurich Central Library that is a scholar's dream: \u201cKoestler, Arthur. Rubaschow: Roman. Typoskript, M\u00e4rz 1940, 326 pages.\u201d What he had found was Arthur Koestler\u2019s original, complete German manuscript for what would become Darkness at Noon, thought to have been irrevocably lost in the turmoil of the war. With this stunning literary discovery, and a new English translation direct from the primary German manuscript, we can now for the first time read Darkness at Noon as Koestler wrote it. Set in the 1930s at the height of the purge and show trials of a Stalinist Moscow, Darkness at Noon is a haunting portrait of an aging revolutionary, Nicholas Rubashov, who is imprisoned, tortured, and forced through a series of hearings by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he re-lives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and betrayals of a merciless totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Koestler\u2019s portrayal of Stalin-era totalitarianism and fascism is as chilling and resonant today as it was in the 1940s and during the Cold War. Rubashov\u2019s plight explores the meaning and value of moral choices, the attractions and dangers of idealism, and the corrosiveness of political corruption.

What do such disparate figures have in common? Why do their extraordinary stories continue to amaze and inspire? In delivering the answers to those questions, Nancy Koehn offers a remarkable template by which to judge those in our own time to whom the public has given its trust. She begins each of the book\u2019s five sections by showing her protagonist on the precipice of a great crisis: Shackleton marooned on an Antarctic ice floe; Lincoln on the verge of seeing the Union collapse; escaped slave Douglass facing possible capture; Bonhoeffer agonizing over how to counter absolute evil with faith; Carson racing against the cancer ravaging her in a bid to save the planet. The narrative then reaches back to each person\u2019s childhood and shows the individual growing\u2014step by step\u2014into the person he or she will ultimately become. Significantly, as we follow each leader\u2019s against-all-odds journey, we begin to glean an essential truth: leaders are not born but made.

Muslim volunteers came from distant lands to fight in Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside their co-religionists, offering themselves as an alternative to the US-led international community.

Benjamin argues that automation, far from being a sinister story of racist programmers scheming on the dark web, has the potential to hide, speed up, and deepen discrimination while appearing neutral and even benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era. Presenting the concept of the \u201cNew Jim Code,\u201d she shows how a range of discriminatory designs encode inequity by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies; by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions; or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. Moreover, she makes a compelling case for race itself as a kind of technology, designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice in the architecture of everyday life. This illuminating guide provides conceptual tools for decoding tech promises with sociologically informed skepticism. In doing so, it challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold but also the ones we ourselves manufacture.

But most Indigenous activism remains unseen in the mainstream--and so, of course, does its significance. J. Kehaulani Kauanui set out to change that with her radio program Indigenous Politics. Issue by issue, she interviewed people who talked candidly and in an engaging way about how settler colonialism depends on erasing Native peoples and about how Native peoples can and do resist. Collected here, these conversations speak with clear and compelling voices about a range of Indigenous politics that shape everyday life. Land desecration, treaty rights, political status, cultural revitalization: these are among the themes taken up by a broad cross-section of interviewees from across the United States and from Canada, Mexico, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Australia, and New Zealand. Some speak from the thick of political action, some from a historical perspective, others from the reaches of Indigenous culture near and far. Writers, like Comanche Paul Chaat Smith, author of Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong, expand on their work--about gaming and sovereignty, for example, or protecting Native graves, the reclamation of land, or the erasure of Indian identity. These conversations both inform and engage at a moment when their messages could not be more urgent.

But in this major new work, Bancroft Prize-winning scholar Odd Arne Westad argues that the Cold War must be understood as a global ideological confrontation, with early roots in the Industrial Revolution and ongoing repercussions around the world. In The Cold War, Westad offers a new perspective on a century when great power rivalry and ideological battle transformed every corner of our globe. From Soweto to Hollywood, Hanoi, and Hamburg, young men and women felt they were fighting for the future of the world. The Cold War may have begun on the perimeters of Europe, but it had its deepest reverberations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, where nearly every community had to choose sides. And these choices continue to define economies and regimes across the world. Today, many regions are plagued with environmental threats, social divides, and ethnic conflicts that stem from this era. Its ideologies influence China, Russia, and the United States; Iraq and Afghanistan have been destroyed by the faith in purely military solutions that emerged from the Cold War. Stunning in its breadth and revelatory in its perspective, this book expands our understanding of the Cold War both geographically and chronologically, and offers an engaging new history of how today's world was created.", "page_count": 720, "google_rating": 4.5, "num_reviews": 2, "class_objects": ["HIST2214-100"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-5438-0149-1", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781543801491", "isbn10": "1543801498", "title": "Federal Income Taxation", "author": "['Joseph Bankman', 'Daniel N.

At its center is a romance: the story of the author's relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson's account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, offers a firsthand account of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making. Writing in the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.", "page_count": 160, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 1186, "class_objects": ["ENGL2592-1", "ENGL4560-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-55597-758-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781555977580", "isbn10": "1555977588", "title": "Bestiary: Poems", "author": "['Donika Kelly']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iLMWDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iLMWDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.0, "bookstore_used_price": 9.55, "publisher": "Macmillan", "date": "2016-10-11", "description": "Donika Kelly's fierce debut collection, long-listed for the 2016 National Book Award and winner of the 2015 Cave Canem Poetry Prize I thought myself lion and serpent.

Written with insight and literary flair, his letters provide a vidid portrait of the war as seen through the eyes of a black volunteer. From basic training at Camp Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts, through campaigns in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, Gooding faithfully records the activities of the 54th, including the legendary storming of Fort Wagner. He also voices the injustice felt by soldiers of his regiment over the issue of unequal pay, the refusal to promote deserving black enlistees to officer rank, and the deeply ingrained racism of whites in both the North and South. Wounded and captured during the battle of Olustee, Florida, in February 1864, Gooding died later that year in Andersonville Prison. In her introduction, Virginia M.

It is also for families of victims and survivors of CPR. It will engage emergency personnel, others in the medical field, and anyone concerned with ethical issues of death and dying. Anyone who has ever taken a CPR course has wondered, \"What would happen if I actually had to use CPR?\" In Western societies, the lifesaving power of resuscitation has the status of a revered cultural myth. It promises life in the face of sudden death, but the reality is that lives are rarely saved. Medical researchers estimate the survival rate for out-of-hospital CPR to be between 1 and 3 percent. Sudden Death and the Myth of CPR explores the history of this medical innovation and the promotion of its effectiveness. The overuse of resuscitation, Timmermans explains, defines people's experience with sudden death, something he learned firsthand by following the practice of lifesaving from street corner to emergency room. He argues that very few people are successfully resuscitated without brain damage despite the promotion of CPR's effectiveness through powerful media images. In vivid accounts of the day-to-day practices of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in one of the only studies o f sudden death, Timmermans records the astonishingly frank comments of emergency personnel. Doctors, nurses, social workers, and paramedics express emotions from cynicism about going through the futile motions to genuine concern for victims' family members. If a person who was supposed to keep on living dies at the end of a resuscitative attempt, how socially meaningful is the dying? Timmermans asks tough questions and addresses the controversial ethical issues about the appropriateness of interfering with life and death.

On Such a Full Sea takes Chang-rae Lee's elegance of prose, his masterly storytelling, and his long-standing interests in identity, culture, work, and love, and lifts them to a new plane. Stepping from the realistic and historical territories of his previous work, Lee brings us into a world created from scratch. Against a vividly imagined future America, Lee tells a stunning, surprising, and riveting story that will change the way readers think about the world they live in. In a future, long-declining America, society is strictly stratified by class. Long-abandoned urban neighborhoods have been repurposed as highwalled, self-contained labor colonies. And the members of the labor class--descendants of those brought over en masse many years earlier from environmentally ruined provincial China--find purpose and identity in their work to provide pristine produce and fish to the small, elite, satellite charter villages that ring the labor settlement. In this world lives Fan, a female fish-tank diver, who leaves her home in the B-Mor settlement (once known as Baltimore), when the man she loves mysteriously disappears. Fan's journey to find him takes her out of the safety of B-Mor, through the anarchic Open Counties, where crime is rampant with scant governmental oversight, and to a faraway charter village, in a quest that will soon become legend to those she left behind.", "page_count": 432, "google_rating": 3.5, "num_reviews": 32, "class_objects": ["AMST4500-4", "ENGL4561-4"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-59558-643-8", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781595586438", "isbn10": "1595586431", "title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "author": "['Michelle Alexander']", "req_type": "Attnd First", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_SKbzXqmawoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_SKbzXqmawoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 19.95, "bookstore_used_price": 14.95, "publisher": "The New Press", "date": "2012", "description": "Argues that the War on Drugs and policies that deny convicted felons equal access to employment, housing, education and public benefits create a permanent under-caste based largely on race.

Yet it would be another twenty years before they would experience something akin to the national fame and recognition that African American men had known since the 1930s, the days of Joe Louis and Jesse Owens. From the 1920s, when black women athletes were confined to competing within the black community, through the heady days of the late twentieth century when they ruled the world of women's track and field, African American women found sport opened the door to a better life. However, they also discovered that success meant challenging perceptions that many Americans--both black and white--held of them. Through the stories of six athletes--Coachman, Ora Washington, Althea Gibson, Wilma Rudloph, Wyomia Tyus, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee--Jennifer H. Lansbury deftly follows the emergence of black women athletes from the African American community; their confrontations with contemporary attitudes of race, class, and gender; and their encounters with the civil rights movement. Uncovering the various strategies the athletes use to beat back stereotypes, Lansbury explores the fullness of African American women's relationship with sport in the twentieth century.", "page_count": 300, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["WGS3240-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-61091-538-0", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781610915380", "isbn10": "1610915380", "title": "Chasing Water: A Guide for Moving from Scarcity to Sustainability", "author": "['Brian Richter']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5-PjwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5-PjwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 26.0, "bookstore_used_price": 19.4, "publisher": "Island Press", "date": "2014-06-03", "description": "Water scarcity is spreading and intensifying in many regions of the world, with dire consequences for local communities, economies, and freshwater ecosystems.

International water expert Brian Richter argues that sustainable water sharing in the twenty-first century can only happen through open, democratic dialogue and local collective action. In Chasing Water, Richter tells a cohesive and complete story of water scarcity: where it is happening, what is causing it, and how it can be addressed. Through his engaging and nontechnical style, he strips away the complexities of water management to its bare essentials, providing information and practical examples that will empower community leaders, activists, and students to develop successful and long-lasting water programs.

Louv interviews researchers, theologians, wildlife experts, indigenous healers, psychologists, and others to show how people are communicating with animals in ancient and new ways; how dogs can teach children ethical behavior; how animal-assisted therapy may yet transform the mental health field; and what role the human-animal relationship plays in our spiritual health. He reports on wildlife relocation and on how the growing populations of wild species in urban areas are blurring the lines between domestic and wild animals.

This breakthrough book builds the foundation every student needs, from freshman orientation to graduate school. The second edition of this bestselling student text has been considerably updated with the latest findings from cognitive science that further illuminate learning for students, and help them understand what's involved in retaining new information. Beyond updating every chapter with insights from new research, this edition introduces a range of additional topics - such as cognitive load, learned helplessness, and persistence - all of which provide students with immediately usable information on how to regulate their lives to maximize learning and fulfillment in college. The premise of this book remains that brain science shows that most students' learning strategies are highly inefficient, ineffective or just plain wrong; and that while all learning requires effort, better learning does not require more effort, but rather effectively aligning how the brain naturally learns with the demands of intellectual work. This book explicates for students what is involved in learning new material, how the human brain processes new information, and what it takes for that information to stick, even after the test. This succinct book explains straightforward strategies for changing how to prepare to learn, engage with course material, and set about improving recall of newly learned material at will.

In 1929, in the blue-collar city of Portsmouth, Ohio, a company built a swimming pool the size of a football field; named Dreamland, it became the vital center of the community. Now, addiction has devastated Portsmouth, as it has hundreds of small rural towns and suburbs across America--addiction like no other the country has ever faced. How that happened is the riveting story of Dreamland. With a great reporter's narrative skill and the storytelling ability of a novelist, acclaimed journalist Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of capitalism run amok whose unintentional collision has been catastrophic. The unfettered prescribing of pain medications during the 1990s reached its peak in Purdue Pharma's campaign to market OxyContin, its new, expensive--extremely addictive--miracle painkiller. Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin--cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico's west coast, independent of any drug cartel--assaulted small town and mid-sized cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system. Together these phenomena continue to lay waste to communities from Tennessee to Oregon, Indiana to New Mexico. Introducing a memorable cast of characters--pharma pioneers, young Mexican entrepreneurs, narcotics investigators, survivors, and parents--Quinones shows how these tales fit together.

A riveting narrative of espionage and geopolitical turmoil.\u201d \u2014Los Angeles Review of Books Centuries have passed since the Communist Federation defeated the capitalist Empire, but humanity is still divided. A vast artificial-intelligence network, a psychiatric bureaucracy, and a tiny egalitarian council oversee civil affairs and quash \u201cabnormal\u201d attitudes such as romantic love.

The 9.0-magnitude quake threw up a devastating tsunami that wiped away entire towns, and caused, in the months afterward, three nuclear meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. Altogether, it was the costliest natural disaster in human history. This is not the story of that disaster. This is the story of a man who took a job. Kazuto Tatsuta was an amateur artist who signed onto the dangerous task of cleaning up the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant, which the workers came to call \"Ichi-F.\" This is the story of that challenging work, of the trials faced by the local citizens, and of the unique camaraderie that built up between the mostly blue-collar workers who had to face the devious and invisible threat of radiation on a daily basis. After six months, Tatsuta's body had absorbed the maximum annual dose of radiation allowed by regulations, and he was forced to take a break from the work crew, giving him the time to create this unprecedented, unauthorized, award-winning view of daily life at Fukushima Daiichi. \"I drew this manga because I wanted people to see what day-to-day life at the nuclear power plant is like. Because I believe that's essential to the future of our country.\" -Kazuto Tatsuta", "page_count": 536, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["HIEA1501-4"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-63243-049-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781632430496", "isbn10": "1632430495", "title": "From Unincorporated Territory [hacha]", "author": "['Craig Santos Perez']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m0QetAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m0QetAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 17.95, "bookstore_used_price": 13.45, "publisher": "Omnidawn", "date": "2017", "description": "The first installment in the Chamorro poet's series on the history, ecology, and mythology of Guam", "page_count": 104, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ENGL8596-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-63243-052-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781632430526", "isbn10": "1632430525", "title": "Ghost Of", "author": "['Diana Khoi Nguyen']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dV2BtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dV2BtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 17.95, "bookstore_used_price": 13.46, "publisher": "Omnidawn Open", "date": "2018", "description": "Winner of the Omnidawn Open Poetry Book Prize", "page_count": 88, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["ENCW3310-2"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-63282-451-6", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781632824516", "isbn10": "1632824515", "title": "Patent Law and Policy: Cases and Materials", "author": "['Robert Patrick Merges', 'John Fitzgerald Duffy']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BTMQMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BTMQMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 202.0, "bookstore_used_price": 151.6, "publisher": "", "date": "2017-01-13", "description": "This updated seventh edition provides numerous diagrams and figures, concise explanations of relevant legal principles, and, to the extent possible, cases involving relatively simple technologies.

In her New York Times bestseller White Rage, Carol Anderson laid bare an insidious history of policies that have systematically impeded black progress in America, from 1865 to our combustible present. With One Person, No Vote, she chronicles a related history: the rollbacks to African American participation in the vote since the 2013 Supreme Court decision that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Known as the Shelby ruling, this decision effectively allowed districts with a demonstrated history of racial discrimination to change voting requirements without approval from the Department of Justice. Focusing on the aftermath of Shelby, Anderson follows the astonishing story of government-dictated racial discrimination unfolding before our very eyes as more and more states adopt voter suppression laws. In gripping, enlightening detail she explains how voter suppression works, from photo ID requirements to gerrymandering to poll closures. In a powerful new afterword, she examines the repercussions of the 2018 midterm elections.

In 1981, fifty individuals--Republican operatives, evangelical Christians, oil barons, gun lobbyists--founded the Council for National Policy to coordinate strategy. Its participants would channel money and media, and mobilize votes behind the scenes. Membership would be secret. The group wielded a broadcasting empire to flood underserved heartland media markets with its propaganda; funded handpicked colleges to launch radically libertarian ideas; and groomed up-and-coming politicians to promote its cause. As the power of voter data to swing elections became clear, the movement joined the Koch brothers to outmaneuver the Democratic Party in an information arms race--one the Democrats may yet be able to win.

The creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional company and became something much more unusual: an international corporation transformed into an aggressive colonial power. Over the course of the next 47 years, the company's reach grew until almost all of India south of Delhi was effectively ruled from a boardroom in the city of London. The Anarchy tells one of history's most remarkable stories: how the Mughal Empire-which dominated world trade and manufacturing and possessed almost unlimited resources-fell apart and was replaced by a multinational corporation based thousands of miles overseas, and answerable to shareholders, most of whom had never even seen India and no idea about the country whose wealth was providing their dividends.

She looks back at her religious adolescence, unpacks the stereotype of lesbian relationships as safe and utopian, and widens the view with essayistic explorations of the history and reality of abuse in queer relationships. Machado\u2019s dire narrative is leavened with her characteristic wit, playfulness, and openness to inquiry.

After the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, Japan and the United States are officially at war. The two rival navies engage in a deadly game of feint and thrust, waging a series of microwars across the tiny Pacific islands. From Guadalcanal to Okinawa, Japan slowly loses ground. Finally, the United States unleashes the deathblow with a new and terrible weapon--the atomic bomb. The fallout from the bombs is beyond imagining.

Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group. Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him.

Recently, though, talk has turned to Africa rising, with enthusiastic voices exclaiming the potential for economic growth across many of its countries. What, then, is the truth behind Africa\u2019s growth, or lack of it? In this provocative book, Morten Jerven fundamentally reframes the debate, challenging mainstream accounts of African economic history. Whilst for the past two decades experts have focused on explaining why there has been a \u2018chronic failure of growth\u2019 in Africa, Jerven shows that most African economies have been growing at a rapid pace since the mid nineties. In addition, African economies grew rapidly in the fifties, the sixties, and even into the seventies.

Hybrid Genre. Animal & Environmental Studies. Regional Studies. The history of Illinois, more an idea than a state, is re-presented in the prose poems of LITERATURE FOR NONHUMANS. Illinois was once an ecoparadise teeming with indigenous species. Now it is, Gabriel Gudding tells us, a \"notable absence of nonhuman animal,\" and a starting place to turn inside-out the language of everyday slaughter. (\"An Illinois,\" he writes, \"is any region that conceives of the river as a drain.\") Gudding's historiographic prose poetry illustrates our changed relation to nonhuman animals. Over and over, we return to the legal torture of pigs explained matter-of-factly by slaughterhouse manuals of the present day. The extended poem- cum-expository essay displays the wild nonhumans of Illinois-birds, mammals, and more- renamed to parody the language of biologists, whose language is a different kind of animal cage. As Gudding tries to break the syntax and shape of language itself, he is fenced in yet again by impenetrable bureaucratic jargon on the slaughter (the \"care\") of nonhumans. We even relate to rivers differently in \"an apocalypse that cannot be seen\" because we don't want to see it. Humans hew forests, drain wetlands, make species extinct, and this poet mourns even through his jeremiad. Gudding's afterword is plea and manifesto; every word of LITERATURE FOR NONHUMANS is crucial to a world in which even simple morality strains for life. \"Just as Sinclair exposed humanity's lack of humanity in The Jungle over a hundred years ago, Gudding creates, in LITERATURE FOR NONHUMANS, a vivid lyric investigation of our society's current slide from an age of destruction into a new age of extinctions. In this multidisciplinary & interdisciplinary text, Gudding notches every inch between lament and manifesto and intersects every topic from here (piglets, zombies, Illinois) to heaven where, upon arrival, we find 'Christ as an anal robot-king we've set narratively running at the edge of history to serve as a reparator by vicarious redemption.'

Early adulthood is filled with intense emotions and insecurity. What if you never fall in love? What if you can't find work you're passionate about? You miss home. You miss close friends. You're lost in the noise of how you think you should be living and worried about wasting what everyone says should be the best years of your life. What Now? shares mindfulness practices to help twentysomethings learn to identify and accept these feelings and respond--not react--to painful and powerful stimuli without pushing them away or getting lost in them. This is not about fixing oneself or being \"better.\" Readers are encouraged to embrace themselves exactly as they are. You are already completely whole, completely loveable, completely worthy. What Now? shares practices that help us to wake up to this fact. This uniquely tumultuous developmental period is a time when many first live away from home and engage in all kinds of experimentation--with ideas, substances, relationships, and who we think we are and want to be in the world. Yael Shy shares her own story and offers basic meditation guides to beginning a practice. She explores the Buddhist framework for what causes suffering and explores ideas about interconnection and social justice as natural outgrowths of meditation practice.", "page_count": 224, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["COMM4831-ALL"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-942134-11-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781942134114", "isbn10": "1942134118", "title": "Wicked Weeds: A Zombie Novel", "author": "['Pedro Cabiya']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AdHioQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AdHioQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 16.95, "bookstore_used_price": 12.66, "publisher": "", "date": "2016-10-25", "description": "A Zombie's search for his lost humanity and the intellectual quest of the only woman who can bestow it.", "page_count": 184, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["AAS4570-1", "ENGL4560-3"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-1-942223-18-4", "fields": {"isbn13": "9781942223184", "isbn10": "1942223188", "title": "Assessing English Learners In U.s.

He's popular and well-adjusted, star of the school football team, while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her job at Marianne's house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers--one they are determined to conceal. A year later, they're both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. And as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.

ENGLISH DESCRIPTION \"This isn't a fairy tale, detective,\" he interrupted again. \"This is a story about love.\" \"About indifference,\" I corrected in turn. An ex-detective returns, after a long time and many failures, to take on a case: find and bring back a woman who abandoned her husband to flee with another man into the taiga. This betrayed husband is convinced--thanks to a brief telegram he received--that in reality his second ex-wife wants to be found. The crime writer has hired a translator to live in the forest with her, where strange things happen, where reality becomes distorted, and where translation itself starts to betray the meaning of language and the senses. They say that the people who live in the taiga go crazy from the desperation to leave. The taiga is monotony and loneliness, a territory invaded by the primitive excesses of capitalism (accumulation and expulsion, corruption and cruelty), although the lessons of her journey will be more about survival than morals: just like love can fly, so can indifference.

My ?rst introduction to the subject was in response to a need for information about a speci?c problem in Tribology. As a practising Engineer with a background only in elementary Mechanics of - terials, I approached that problem initially using the concepts of concentrated forces and superposition. Today, with a rather more extensive knowledge of analytical techniques in Elasticity, I still ?nd it helpful to go back to these roots in the elementary theory and think through a problem physically as well as mathematically, whenever some new and unexpected feature presents di?culties in research. This way of thinking will be found to permeate this book. My engineering background will also reveal itself in a tendency to work examples through to ?nal expressions for stresses and displacements, rather than leave the derivation at a point where the remaining manipulations would be mathematically routine. The ?rst edition of this book, published in 1992, was based on a one semester graduate course on Linear Elasticity that I have taught at the U- versity of Michigan since 1983.", "page_count": 534, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["MAE6070-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-93-5177-397-9", "fields": {"isbn13": "9789351773979", "isbn10": "9351773973", "title": "Hindutva: Exploring the Idea of Hindu Nationalism", "author": "['Jyotirmaya Sharma']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7JsgjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7JsgjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 14.99, "bookstore_used_price": 11.25, "publisher": "Harpercollins", "date": "2015-09-17", "description": "The upsurge of militant Hindu nationalism in the recent past has brought to the fore questions of who a Hindu is, what Hinduism is and what Hindutva and Hinduism mean to Hindus. If Hindutva is a way of life, who are its followers? And for those who are, how necessary is it that its practice should prevail upon all others? These are questions of great relevance in today's India. This revised edition of Hindutva, which includes a new essay and introduction, goes beyond the existing inquiry into Hindu identity, nationalism and culture, through the writings of thinkers Dayananda Saraswati, Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. With characteristic academic rigour and research, Jyotirmaya Sharma offers us original insights into the intellectual traditions that have nourished political Hindutva. The book calls for revisiting those traditions in which Hinduism is seen as being more inclusive and self-critical, at times even of its own fundamental premises.", "page_count": 248, "google_rating": 0.0, "num_reviews": 0, "class_objects": ["RELH3440-1"]}}, {"model": "textbook_exchange.textbook", "pk": "978-950-515-004-5", "fields": {"isbn13": "9789505150045", "isbn10": "9505150040", "title": "La Guaracha Del Macho Camacho (spanish Edition)", "author": "['Luis Rafael Sanchez']", "req_type": "Required", "cover_photo_url": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/45/9789505150045.jpg", "cover_photo": "", "bookstore_new_price": 17.95, "bookstore_used_price": 13.5, "publisher": "De La Flor S.r.l.
