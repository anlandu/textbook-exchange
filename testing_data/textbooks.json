In this fourth edition, the change of the subtitle to \"Application to Nursing Research \"and \"Practice\" better reflects the dynamic relationship between theory, research, and practice with an increased emphasis on applications of middle range theories to practice. The authors provide expert advice on selecting the appropriate theory for a nursing research project and developing the critical thinking skills needed to critique theories. Every theory chapter includes examples of the theories and ways they are used in research, as well as sample applications, and critical thinking exercises. Students can go to thePoint to find a related Theory Analysis exercise and practice their critiquing skills by doing the exercise and then comparing it with a crtique done by an expert in the field.",

        "description": "\"We've got some difficult days ahead,\" civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr., told a crowd gathered at Memphis's Clayborn Temple on April 3, 1968. \"But it really doesn't matter to me now because I've been to the mountaintop. . . . And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.\" These prohetic words, uttered the day before his assassination, challenged those he left behind to see that his \"promised land\" of racial equality became a reality; a reality to which King devoted the last twelve years of his life. These words and other are commemorated here in the only major one-volume collection of this seminal twentieth-century American prophet's writings, speeches, interviews, and autobiographical reflections. A Testament of Hope contains Martin Luther King, Jr.'s essential thoughts on nonviolence, social policy, integration, black nationalism, the ethics of love and hope, and more.",
